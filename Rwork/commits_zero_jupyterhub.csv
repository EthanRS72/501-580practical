Using a rolling update by default on the proxy pod is a mistake by us,
because of the JupyterHub / CHP proxy interaction. JupyterHub assumes in
check_routes / add_route etc to be speaking to one specific CHP proxy
server, but there can be different ones responding if we make an upgrade
and the proxy pod is making a rolling upgrade.

For example, consider a hub pod making a recreate upgrade, and a proxy
pod makinga rolling upgrade. The new hub pod could for example get ready
before the proxy pod and start speaking with the old proxy pod and later
at a crucial point start speaking with the new pod. If you switch to
speaking with the new pod at the wrong time, you may end up with failure
to get responses from user pods that are verified to be around, and then
they are deleted.

So, this commit hope to fix a sneaky bug where user pods are deleted
during upgrades where the proxy pod is also updated!",272,29,0,1

This PR enables all traffic to the *internet* from user pods,
but restricts all access to the private network where other
kubernetes pods or services may be running. Meant to be a
minimally intrusive defense in depth mechanism that prevents
access to unsecured endpoints running on VMs, in the kubernetes
cluster, etc. For example, users often run Prometheus without
any kind of network protection in the same cluster as the
users, and access to prometheus can leak a lot of sensitive
user data.

https://www.wiz.io/blog/chaosdb-explained-azures-cosmos-db-vulnerability-walkthrough
shows the immense security value of restricting access to internal
network from user written code. Most software projects do not have
their authz/authn layers, and rely on network segmentation for
protection. When network segmentation fails like it does in the Azure security incident,
there is often no secondary line of defense.

Most JupyterHub users talk to the internet, but by default I think
nobody really talks to the *internal network*. This also only affects
network connections from user code - stuff like mounting NFS shares
are done by the kubelet, and hence are not affected. Connections
to hub infrastructure (proxy, hub, etc) are also not affected,
as they are separately allowed by other NetworkPolicy rules.",22,56,0,1

It can be a problem to require a pod to be successfully scheduled on all

insufficient pods will fail, not because --wait part of the Helm upgrade
requires daemonset pods to be scheduled and ready because it doesn't,
but because the image-awaiter pod requires the desired number of pods to
be scheduled are scheduled and running.

This PR introduces a flag and sets a default value of 10 for it. Like
this, the criteria to successfully have awaited image pulling is to in
the initial ten seconds either have as many ready image puller pods as
is desired. The difference is that this will change after this initial
duration to something new, namely to wait only for the current number of

This makes it possible to override the `securityContext`
for the hub container spec, similar to how the hub container
`resources` are overridable via `values.yaml`. By defualt the
`securityContext` is the same as before.

One use case for this is to be able to specify `capabilities`
in order to run py-spy [1] on the hub container.

One downside to this approach is that for anyone overriding the
hub container `securityContext` may need to duplicate the
`runAsUser` and `allowPrivilegeEscalation` entries which means
they could fall out of alignment with the upstream chart. So an
alternative to this full replacement approach is to add an
optional `extraContainerSecurityContext` entry similar to how
`extraVolumeMounts` works. The downside to that is it could
eventually conflict with what is not extra in the parent chart.
Another alternative is just adding a very specific and optional
`containerCapabilities` value which if set *only* sets the
`securityContext.capabilities` value in the container spec.

For simplicity and flexibility this opts for the full replacement
approach assuming the hub container `securityContext` will not change
frequently.

nginx proved more complicated than hoped for, primarily due to
lack of hot reloading. The two blockers were:

1. nginx won't start without SSL certs existing, but we won't get
   them until after nginx starts to use the webroot challenge!
2. When certificates get renewed, nginx needs a reload.

We could have fixed these, but I realized the reason we were not
using traefik for this was that it needs persistent disk to put its
let's encrypt config in. Since that is no longer a problem due to
the secret sync, I switched us over to traefik instead. *Much*
cleaner, simpler and straightforward!!!",292,33,0,1

The user-scheduler is great for use with a cluster autoscaler and bad

The cull_idle_servers.py script was started as an executable,
but the mounted file does not have the executable permissions
by default (0644), so i got a permission error.

Weirdly enough it can be resolved by adding mode: 0555 in the
volumeMount entry but that isn't part of the k8s API spec for
volumeMount! This was spotted by kubeval script.

I could set the defaultMode on the configmap volume definition
for the pod spec though. It would work, but it feels too ugly
as the configmap has more entries that shouldn't be considered
executable.

I decided to invoke it explicitly with python and mount it to
/etc/jupyterhub/cull_idle_servers.py instead. I figure that a
file mounted to /usr/local/bin should be executable, this isn't
and the folder named /srv/jupyterhub is already a mount point
for sqlite-pvc so I cannot use that and have a nested mount.",270,29,0,1

Follow-up to #1852. Useful to explicitly expose ports
in deployment too - otherwise you can't use port names like
`ssh` in service definitions. To allow ingress on a port named
`ssh` in traefik right now, you have to know it is listening
on port 8022, and set the following:

```yaml
proxy:
  autohttps:
    networkPolicy:
      allowedIngress: [http, https, 8022]
```

This requires knowledge that `8022` is the ssh port. Instead,
it would be nice to specify `ssh` instead - and that requires
defining that in the deployment. This is true for other places
too - like the service definition.",52,43,0,1

Currently, the pre-puller code is in https://github.com/yuvipanda/kube-image-puller,
which started out as a hopeful go project before becoming a bash project.

This commit is based off that repo, but completely rewrites most of it.

- 'image-puller', a small bash script that pulls docker images.
  This can be used as a daemonset to pull images on all nodes. It currently
  adds a label to nodes after pulling is done, but that probably will
  go away. It only uses curl and jq to talk to APIs, to keep the image
  size as small as possible. The daemonsets are very useful if you are
  running an autoscaling cluster, but they aren't enabled by default.
- 'pre-puller', a small bash script that dynamically creates an image-puller daemonset
  and waits till the image has been pulled on all nodes. This is executed
  as a helm hook. This also only uses curl and jq for image size reasons.",100,9,0,1

I previously removed this logic because it was messy to implement the
deprecation logic, and the container would be so very small anyhow. But,
I realized that the size may only be a smaller part if this matters or
not. Each image needs to be pulled, and if they end up being pulled in
the wrong order, it can be very troublesome.

What could happen without this change, is that the image puller pods
could spend time pulling multiple images, then a user pod arrives to the
node and its image is already pulled and it only needs to pull the small
cloudMetadata blocker image, but, pulling that is blocked currenlty.
Because images are pulled in a sequence as I understand it, so the user
pod arriving may end up needing to wait for its little initContainer
image to be pulled and that is just bad.

So, the it matters if we pull this small image, and it matters when we
pull it. We should pull it the first thing we do.",54,42,0,1

For HTTPS, we want to expose port 443 on our service, but
only if it is 'turned on'. Unfortunately, in v 0.9, the
default was set to 'enabled' but it didn't act as enabled
unless hostnames were actually set. This exposed port 443
in proxy-public regardless of wether we were actually
set up for HTTPS or not. This caused weird issues with
AWS, since it was health checking all exposed ports. Since
we didn't have automatic HTTPS setup (since that needs
hostnames), this broke all installs on AWS!

This tries to be backwards compatible change, exposing
port 443 only if we *really* have https running. This
should fix issues with AWS, and be more 'correct'.

Manual HTTPS doesn't actually need hosts lists to be set,
so we remove that from our documentation.

There is a predefined type for TLS secrets in k8s, and they can be
created with a kubectl command.

Notice `TYPE` in the example below:

```
$ kubectl get secrets -n jupyterhub

user-scheduler-token-hltcf      kubernetes.io/service-account-token   3		1d
```

And how you can create a secret like this using the kubectl command.

```
Usage:
  kubectl create secret tls NAME --cert=path/to/cert/file --key=path/to/key/file [--dry-run] [options]
```

It appears that when we build the docs in the PR preview, it works. But,
when we push to master, it doesn't any more. It appears that using
pydata_sphinx_theme to build PDFs and/or ePub files makes it crash if we
using sphinx3 rather than sphinx2. Since a doc dependency that
(executablebooks/myst-parser) previously was limited to sphinx 2 but not
longer is, the PDF / ePub build made our builds when pushing to master
fail.

I'd like to avoid maintaining these things, and would like to stop
building PDFs and ePub files. I don't know if they are used, but I'd
like to focus attention to https://z2jh.jupyter.org anyhow I think.",135,42,0,1

This address two issues:

1. Line wraps

   I found that if we use MyST links like...

   ```
   {ref}text that could wrap to the next line <schema:hub.config>
   ```

   They would break when they wrap to another line. This doesn't happen
   if we  use the markdown syntax of linking.

2. Failing links

   While it works to translte [link text](some-reference) to function as
   it should, it doesn't work for references like [link
   text](schema:hub.config) for some reason which is probably a bug
   worth reporting.

The extra network hop is worth the following advantages:

1. The code is much easier for us to understand and reason about.
2. We have pod affinity set up to try to place all three components

   should cut down on hops!
3. For users with at least one proxy in front of the hub,
   this is a much cleaner way to disable the extra nginx cost -
   both in terms of resources and extra processing overhead.

Longer term, we should build / use a proxy implementation that
can automatically get certificates from ACME and store them
in Kubernetes Secret objects.",122,11,0,1

The idle culler lives as a script in at least 3 different
places:

    In the JupyterHub repo, as an 'example'
    https://github.com/jupyterhub/jupyterhub/tree/d126baa443ad7d893be2ff4a70afe9ef5b8a4a1a/examples/cull-idle
    In the TLJH repo, as a core part of the service
    https://github.com/jupyterhub/the-littlest-jupyterhub/blob/01ba34857dd4e316d839034ae2b3cc400b929964/tljh/cull_idle_servers.py.
    This is an import from a specific version of the JupyterHub repo,
    and has had a couple of changes made to it since.
    In the z2jh repo, as a core part of the service
    https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/blob/c3f3be25f8ae6c72d02f385f41983b70ee1d416e/jupyterhub/files/hub/cull_idle_servers.py
    This is also an import from a specific version of the JupyterHub
    repo, but has had a lot more work done on it. Most had been sync'd
    back the JupyterHub repo, but some had not been. See
    https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/commits/9c15a42b1227f3b54826f273f1689e4dc8c8e12e/images/hub/cull_idle_servers.py
    and https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/commits/master/jupyterhub/files/hub/cull_idle_servers.py

The idle culler is a core integral part of every JupyterHub deployment
these days. It would be great if it was maintained separately on
its own, without being split across multiple repos.

The latest changes had been to the version in the JupyterHub repo, so I
copied it (while preserving commit history, because credit is important)
to a new repository: https://github.com/yuvipanda/jupyterhub-idle-culler

I looked through z2jh and tljh copies, and cherry-picked the following
changes manually

jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s@ae80fb5
jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s@836f19a
jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s@a0787c6

I could not apply, but mostly because those features had been
re-implemented already.

Right now, the package is a direct port of the code we had. Once
this settles in, I am hopefull we can iterate faster and make cool
new changes.",314,37,0,1

<core|user> pods now get `tolerations` for the node taint

be added to nodes or all nodes in a node group (aka. node pool).

Note that due to a bug with using the `gcloud` CLI, we also add the
toleration for the same taint where `/` is replaced with `_`.

When the autohttps deployment is updating, it keeps existing connections

connections.

After it has closed itself for new connections, it is still considered 
ready by the service that delegates traffic, so that makes the pod 
continue to receive traffic that will crash.

With this change, it will stop receiving traffic, which is preferred as 
it isn't actually doing its job to receive it as it should any more at

Currently, port 443 is exposed by default. This causes
issues when cloud providers (like AWS) health check all
exposed ports. Since nothing is listening to port 443,
it fails & causes general madness.

This requires users explicitly set https to enabled,
but explicit is better than implicit in this case
I think. We have too many HTTPS options to try and
auto-detect that, and currently the option we have
basically fails HTTPS on AWS

When we
[picked](https://github.com/jupyterhub/zero-to-jupyterhub-k8s/pull/229)
kube-lego to do automatic HTTPS in 2017, it seemed the easiest and
most kubernetes native way to do let's encrypt based HTTPS. It was
fairly simple, and worked pretty well for our use case. Users of
this chart could set up HTTPS without having to know anything about
certificates, challenges or let's encrypt. Life was good.

Life moves on, and so does code. kube-lego was deprecated in
favor of [cert-manager](https://github.com/jetstack/cert-manager),
which was far more general. It wasn't tied to Let's Encrypt,
and could do a lot more things. It was far more kubernetes native,
and slicker. However, this came with a massive increase in
complexity, which is justifyable if you need many certificates in
many situations. However, for the most common case of just one
certificate per hub, this was super massive overkill.

This PR replaces the current autohttps with autocertbot, a tiny
wrapper around the recommended upstream let's encrypt software -
[certbot](https://certbot.eff.org/). certbot requires persistent
storage under /etc/letsencrypt, and we would prefer to not. This
was the primary reason I picked kube-lego over certbot back in
the day. However, a small wrapper script that sync's the contents
of /etc/letsencrypt to a kubernetes secret when needed is small,
easy to reason about and solves all our problems.

This PR should be fully backwards compatible. autocertbot should
be able to renew certificates that kube-lego was handling before,
and issue new certificates as well. Since it is just wrapping
upstream certbot, there are fewer chances of a deprecation hitting
us hard.

If a k8s cluster has a LimitRange resource, it may end up for example
allocating 100m CPU for containers which is a waste of resources. This
would be a waste as the running container only does `sh -c ""Done!""`
anyhow. While there is image pulling happening, that is done before the
actual container starts so its worth noting we don't need any resources
specified for that.

Another reason for specifying resources, and making them configurable,
is that sometimes there is a ResourceQuota resource that requires the
resources to be explicitly specified on pods.

This memory limit seems to include pod overhead, which
can be variable based on cluster config. In my cluster (AKS)
with Calico enabled, the memory limit was too low and kept
crashing these pods with very weird reasons - the usual
reasons aren't reported since it's not *our* process that
is causing OOM kills, but the cluster's overhead.

By removing the default resource limits, we prevent thi
from being a problem. Theoretically this would let the pods
have unbounded memory - but since we control the contents,
it wouldn't be the case.

We leave the explicit default requests be, for reasons
outlined in

TravisCI would make two builds if a commit and a tag referencing this
commit was pushed. This could lead to duplication of chart build and
publishing jobs. So, I disabled the tag triggered builds before to avoid
this, in case we ended up with duplicated entries or failure due to
existing entries etc.

In this PR, with chartpress 0.4.2 and the --long flag, we can let both
bulds finish. There are some key benefits.

1. We can now push a tag retrospectively now to trigger a build.
2. We avoid a failure to build a tag because it was pushed not as the
HEAD commit but some steps down the history.
3. We can still build on all pushed commits to master for dev releases.",275,30,0,1

Some of the motivations for this choice is captured below:

1. Most other Helm chart defaults to having PDBs disabled by default
   making our chart's behaviour unexpected.

2. The idea of using a PDB is tightly coupled with applications that
   support high availability, in other words, to run in parallell to
   another. But, the hub/proxy/autohttps pod doesn't support it. As an
   indication of this, see the k8s docs on ""configure-pdb"" which has a
   ""Before you begin"" section that sais ""You are the owner of an
   application runniong on a Kubernetes cluster that requires high
   availability.

   ref: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/run-application/configure-pdb/

3. When evictions take place, such as when a node is drained, the PDBs
   will be respected, and since we have `minAvailable: 1` and cannot
   create another one, a manual pod deletion is required.

   It is my perception that the act of draining a node should come with
   intent and consideration typically. If it comes as part of an
   automated k8s upgrade of nodes, it should at least be scheduled at a
   acceptable time window etc. So, it wouldn't be helpful to add the
   need to run `kubect delete pod` alongside this.

4. If the wish is to avoid making the cluster autoscaler relocate a pod
   part of a deployment, then it is more direct and sensible to use the
   `""cluster-autoscaler.kubernetes.io/safe-to-evict"": ""false""`
   annotation.

The information about the latest version dev version from the chart repo

made a commit to helm-chart's gh-pages to add a info.json file that
contained exactly the information we require for these badges.

- It wasn't allowed to have a YAML comment before apiVersion, so I
  removed them. An alternative would have been to make the comments Helm
  template comments.
- I updated a comment to be more explicit about port references etc.
- I ensured that we provide the 443 port if we use a k8s secret provided
  to the configurable-http-proxy (proxy pod), and not only if we provide
  certificates. So ""type: manual"" and ""type: secret"" will both ensure we
  expose port 443 on the proxy-public service in other words.",295,41,0,1

Running this script typically takes more than an hour, it takes quite a

relates to:
- running it is a cumbersome step as part of the release process
- running it takes 30-120 minutes to execute
- it includes jupyterhub, kubespawner, oauthenticator as well
- it requires instructions to use and perserverence to use successfully

This commit is not meant to make any changes to the built docs!

The commit is meant to:

1. Improve the docs local development experience
2. Help the projects maintainers maintain this

In this commit:

- Updated the Makefile to automatically get us to a good development
  setup with `sphinx-autobuild` that can automatically rebuild the docs
  and start a livereload enabled webserver as well as open a browser
  window.
- Modified make.bat to the best of my ability to mirror the Makefile
- Refactored doc/conf.py by grouping related options and
  provided inline references to related sphinx configuration options.
- Deleted an seemingly unused environment.yml.
- Updated the doc/README.md instructions.
- Upgraded readthedocs.yml to the new configuration version.",310,36,0,1

This will make the proxy pod quickly terminate instead of taking full 30
seconds to terminate, and that in turn allows for the hub pod to not
crash so much on upgrades as it requires the proxy pod to upgrade first
by shutting down and starting up.
