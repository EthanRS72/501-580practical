@DanielnetoDotCom PLEASE TAKE 5mn TO READ

First , I have really low knowledge of php . I managed to make the script work , but you will have to make it work properly .

The output of the sitemap looks like this :

            </url>

2) Some values will not be accepted by google and other crawlers , such as <video:duration> , since it should be in seconds , and I have no knowlegde how to transform h,m,s into seconds .
3) <video:requires_subscription> , could be improved . On database we have values 0 and 1 for only_for_paid . Crawlers accept the values yes and no . Need to add some coding to make value 0 = no , and 1 = yes
4) <video:tag> This could help a lot of the video SEO , but I don't know how to get it from tags_has_video ( db table )
5) <video:category> Same , when I try with ' . $value['categories_id'] . ' I get only the number , but need to display the name from categories table [name] . 
6) <video:rating> better to ignore for the moment , since the project did not focus much on it , but easly could be implemented
7) <video:content_loc> I ognored this option of lake of knowledge . I can make it work for my site ( since all videos are on hls ) and easly implement .m3u8 . But if a site has mixed content will need extra codes , to determine the video extension . Basically you should point the video root . Example : www.example.com/video/120/test.mp4
8) <video:player_loc> The embedding url ( ignored for now , may impact ads )

You could make it work easly with your knowledge of php .

My problem right now is that you're using a different scheme then the one needed for a video hosting project .

This plugin is meant to communicate to a slack workspace as a bot.  It requires a special bot_user_oauth_access_token that can be generated in your slack workspace, with the required scopes.

This plugin iterates through the users who have subscribed to the current user’s channel.  On each iteration it takes the email from the subscribed user, and sends it to slack to look for a user id.  Then it takes the user id and uses it to send a message to the user via the slack bot channel in slack.

This plugin uses the users:read, and users:read:email scope to retrieve retrieve the slack id for the user",295,20,0,0

-hls_time is really bad on most of the script encoder that we have in this project . I think developers doesn't understand it well . This value has no meaning what so ever and the script will give errors on playlist and in cases completally ignore it ! 
1- You can't set hls_time without indicating a valid GOP ( -g )
2- GOP must be your output frame rate * 2
3- The hls_time must be GOP/FrameRates=hls_time

Example ;  
-r 60 -g 120 -hls_time 2  ( valid values )
-r 60 -g 240 -hls_time 4 (valid value , HIGH latency stream )
-r 30 -g 30 -hls_time 1 ( valid value , LOW latency stream )

-r 20 -g 48 -hls_time 6 ( wrong values , a lot of buffering and weird/unstable hls_playlist , if not completely ignored . The seek bar gonna just be confused ).
