Inspection description:
    Reports String concatenation used as the argument to StringBuffer.append(),
    StringBuilder.append() or Appendable.append().
    Such calls may profitably be turned into chained append calls on the existing
    StringBuffer/Builder/Appendable saving the cost of an extra StringBuffer/Builder allocation.
    This inspection ignores compile-time evaluated String concatenations,
    in which case the conversion would only worsen performance.

    Example:
      void bar(StringBuilder builder, String name) {
        builder.append(""Hello,"" + name);    //warning
        builder.append(""Hello,"" + ""world""); //no warning

replaces normal switch with enhanced switch statements or expressions.

Note: we use a redundant default case where the
default case was the same as one of the normal cases.
This is to avoid a Language Level change to 17 (Preview),
which is only available with the --enable-preview compile
command and would require a more complex java setup.

example:
new switch expression requiring the pattern matching
    case Instruction.CONTINUE_ON_STREET, default -> InstructionType.CONTINUE;

redundant default:
    case Instruction.CONTINUE_ON_STREET -> InstructionType.CONTINUE;
    default -> InstructionType.CONTINUE;

This could be avoided if the default case actually does
something different or the duplicate normal case removed.

As this touches implementation details, it is skipped for now.",26,70,1,0,"2017-09-11 21:11:36","2124.31"

there have been CORS issues when using our map clients with local
ors instances during development due to Problems with what headers are
accepted and exposed by the backend.
With the spring-boot update and the new run configurations using spring,
setting these options properly is now possible for local instances using
`spring-boot:run` or mvn version of it.

However, the docker approach is still using catalina + tomcat where
the settings would be passed differently, so they are not respected in
a local backend running with docker.

- add addCorsMappings function to ApiConfig class
- extent ors-config-sample.json with default cors settings working with
  all origins and accepting `Authorization` headers.
- if the api settings are missing from the ors config file,
 default values are used that correspond with the entries
 in the ors-config-sample.json",45,67,1,0,"2017-09-11 21:11:36","2030.04"

the previous issue template was outdated and people often had
trouble with the markdown format.

By using issue forms, formatting is less error prone,
information more structured and requirements more clear.
The forms can be tailored to the issue category and labels
(or even assignees) automatically applied.

Templates were added for the following categories:
- bug reports: thorough information required
- docs: issue with the GitHub pages documentation
- feature requests
- other issues: simple form for quick issues or technical
problems not fitting the bug report

The config.yml allows for external links which point to the
forum for questions and the ors-map-client repo for issues
with the map application.

The workflow can only be run on workflow_dispatch from the GitHub UI
by ors team members.

Inputs are:
- `osm_file_url`: Download URL to the OSM pbf file (best use geofabrik)
- `environment`: GitHub environment to use
- `config_in_war`: whether the war file should include the config

Check how to create an environment on:
https://heigit.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/openrouteservice/pages/129695876/Graph+Builder+Usage

Outputs graphs, logs, elevation_cache, PBF, war and config to the
`<gh_runner_ors_repo_dir>/envs/ENV_NAME` folder on the server the GitHub runner is on.

chGraph always is of type RoutingCHGraph, which makes this instance of
