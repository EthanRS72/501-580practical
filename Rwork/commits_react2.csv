* fix: Separate 'Item' content into 'label' and 'description'

* fix: Only add 'aria-describedby' when 'description' exists

* fix: Memoize 'id' so 'Item's and labels match

* fix: Don’t rely on 'id' which is possibly not globally-unique

* fix: Restore semi-full-width 'Item' dividers, without giving up the semantic nesting.

By “semantic nesting”, I mean that the 'Item' label and description are now siblings, which is preferable to the previous implementation, where the description node was a child of the label node. As a general principle, we should align DOM hierarchies with information hierarchies. An analogy: If I were using a bulleted list to describe a dog, I would not indent its breed as a second-level bullet beneath the bullet for its name, because a dog’s breed is not dependent/derived data from its name. Similarly, description is not dependent/derived from label, and so should not be nested in DOM.

* fix: Reduce styled-components class permutations.

- https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.1/aria-dialog-name
- https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.2/presentation-role-conflict
- https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/menu-button/menu-button-links.html

First, 'Overlay's aren’t 'listbox'es, because (when used in 'DropdownMenu' or 'ActionMenu') they contain 'menuitem's, 'menuitemradio's, or 'menuitemcheckbox'es.

Second, 'Overlay's aren’t 'dialog's, because (as demonstrated in the WAI ARIA practices page linked above), 'menu's need not be contained in a 'dialog', and also (as noted in the 'aria-dialog-name' link above), 'dialog's must have an 'aria-label', 'aria-labelledby', or 'title', but neither 'DropdownMenu' nor 'ActionMenu' have any kind of header element that could be used for this.

Third, if 'Overlay's are 'none', they can’t be focusable (as noted in the 'presentation-role-conflict' link above), but one of our hooks (maybe 'FocusTrap', maybe 'FocusZone') was setting 'tabIndex' to '0' (in the test component), because it did not contain a focusable child. This PR adds a focusable button child so the 'none' 'Overlay' container won’t receive 'tabIndex' '0'.

plugin, which rewrites any element with a `css` prop and converts it
into a proper styled-component component. See

As we begin to implement things like deprecation warnings that we only
want to appear in non-production environments, it's useful to have an
easy check that completely compiles out in production. This commit
adds `babel-plugin-transform-replace-expressions`, which replaces
expressions in code.

The primary expression is `__DEV__`, which compiles to
`process.env.NODE_ENV !== ""production""`. When building the browser
bundles, we compile it instead to `false`, so that terser automatcally
removes the entire `if(__DEV__)...` block, resulting in zero runtime
overhead.

This commit also adds the define to Gatsby's webpack config, as Gatsby
doesn't seem to respect the Babel configuration for the main Primer
Components project. In addition, to get Gatsby to run Primer Components
through the new webpack plugin we add, we need to alter the webpack
rules to include files loaded from `@primer/components`.

Finally, when building a production build (like in our browser bundles),
we explicitly set `process.env.NODE_ENV` to `""production""`.",38,26,0,0,"2018-02-17 00:09:06","804.3"

* Add prop to hide selection component if needed.

* Linting fixes.

* Fix type-check errors.

* Update themePreval snapshot again.

* Fix themePreval snapshot to match origin. Unsure why it's not generating the same way.

* Hide selections in MarkdownEditor saved replies.

* Remove hideSelection prop and add defaultRenderFn to FilteredActionList so these don't have to be defined manually everywhere.

* Fix selection rendering (needed explicit selected boolean) and fix SelectPanel docs.

* Pass selectionVariant illegally to SelectPanel in src/MarkdownEditor/_SavedReplies.tsx so Selection components don't render.

* Remove remaining references of hideSelection prop.

* Update changeset to reflect that changes impact SelectPanel.

* Remove renderFn prop from SelectPanel and use default for FilteredActionList, which seems to cover most cases.

* Fix truncation in SavedReplies descriptions.

* Update generated/components.json

* Fix linting error.

* Don't make renderFn a prop (if we need to make this configurable, we can expose it later. Use maxWidth 100% for SavedReplies truncation.

* Use showDividers prop in SelectPanel story.

* Formatting.

* Add temporary support for showItemDividers prop to SelectPanel to keep backwards compatibility.

* Support passing deprecated showItemDividers prop in ActionList.

I also took this as an opportunity to bump the alt-text-bot version and give you access to reminders in discussions

* fix: Separate 'Item' content into 'label' and 'description'

* fix: Only add 'aria-describedby' when 'description' exists

* fix: Memoize 'id' so 'Item's and labels match

* fix: Don’t rely on 'id' which is possibly not globally-unique

* fix: Restore semi-full-width 'Item' dividers, without giving up the semantic nesting.

By “semantic nesting”, I mean that the 'Item' label and description are now siblings, which is preferable to the previous implementation, where the description node was a child of the label node. As a general principle, we should align DOM hierarchies with information hierarchies. An analogy: If I were using a bulleted list to describe a dog, I would not indent its breed as a second-level bullet beneath the bullet for its name, because a dog’s breed is not dependent/derived data from its name. Similarly, description is not dependent/derived from label, and so should not be nested in DOM.

- https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.1/aria-dialog-name
- https://dequeuniversity.com/rules/axe/4.2/presentation-role-conflict
- https://www.w3.org/TR/wai-aria-practices-1.1/examples/menu-button/menu-button-links.html

First, 'Overlay's aren’t 'listbox'es, because (when used in 'DropdownMenu' or 'ActionMenu') they contain 'menuitem's, 'menuitemradio's, or 'menuitemcheckbox'es.

Second, 'Overlay's aren’t 'dialog's, because (as demonstrated in the WAI ARIA practices page linked above), 'menu's need not be contained in a 'dialog', and also (as noted in the 'aria-dialog-name' link above), 'dialog's must have an 'aria-label', 'aria-labelledby', or 'title', but neither 'DropdownMenu' nor 'ActionMenu' have any kind of header element that could be used for this.

Third, if 'Overlay's are 'none', they can’t be focusable (as noted in the 'presentation-role-conflict' link above), but one of our hooks (maybe 'FocusTrap', maybe 'FocusZone') was setting 'tabIndex' to '0' (in the test component), because it did not contain a focusable child. This PR adds a focusable button child so the 'none' 'Overlay' container won’t receive 'tabIndex' '0'.
