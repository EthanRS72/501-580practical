This patch adds the logic to delete the k8s node from the cluster
corresponding to the VM. This is necessary in cases where the node is
never in the Ready state which leads to the node never getting removed
from the cluster. This leads to a lot of stale nodes showing on the
cluster with an active MHC.

During the VM reconciliation, the controllers track down the parent of
the Machine objects using the owner reference hierarchy. The owner
reference checks were comparing the Group as well as the API version to
determins and fetch the owner.

Currently, the API version used for comparison was selected from the
storageVersion of the CAPI objects on the API server. Due to this, any
objects created via an earlier CAPI version, say v1alpha3, which sets
the owner reference API version to group name + v1alpha3 were not being
found since no such object would exist. A similar object with the
updated API type is stored in the api server.

This drify happens since CAPI does not update the owner references of
the objects when moving to newer API versions. There is an issue
tracking this https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/issues/7224
which will solve the stale owner ref API version problem. Until then we
are dropping the version check and just relying on the group info and
kind combination to fetch the parent object.

This updates the version of golangcli-lint we are using to 1.43.0. This
version picks up linter releases that address issues when running under
go 1.17. This prepares us for eventually raising the required golang
version for the project and makes sure developers that have newer
versions installed can run local tests without issues.

The newer versoin of golangci-lint brings with it additional checks that
were not enforced before. Due to that, in addition to raising the
golangci-lint version this also fixes a lot of (most minor) things that
the newer version uncovered.

This touchs a very large number of files. In almost all cases though,
the changes in these files are very minor cosmetic updates.

warning is introduced on the VSphereCluster object and the cluster

The code now acts accordingly based on the availability of the new cloud-init datasource
""VMwareGuestInfo"" inside the template used. This availability can be set by the users in
the spec using the flag ""vsphereCloudInit"" set to true. For usual upstream version of
ubuntu cloud image that has been used so far, this flag need not be set at all and the
controller will utilize the OVF properties available on the ubuntu cloud image to inject
the cloud-init data.
Note: The new static IP support is only available with the templates that have the vsphere
cloud-init datasource. DHCP based IPs will continue to work as they have in the past.

Going forward we prefer users creating a custom ubuntu cloud image that also has this new
cloud-init datasource pre-installed. As that will give them the ability to use static IPs
as well if they want.

See https://github.com/akutz/cloud-init-vmware-guestinfo for more info on the new cloud-init
datasource

1. VSphere DRS enforces host placement according to affinity rules
   before powering on the VM. Since, the VM was being added after being
   powered on, the host placement wasn't being enforced.
   Add the VM to the VM group before powering it on, makes sure that
   the placement constraint is enforced.
2. Instead of re-creating the same category with a new associable type
   (which is not supported by Vsphere), we are now patching the category
   to update the associable type for a category.
3. Updating the failure domain on the VSphereMachine is not allowed,
   hence removed it.

The provider service account and service discovery controllers had an
inherent assumption that the names of the Cluster and VSphereCluster
object is the same. Hence the logic to fetch the secret containing the
kubeconfig of the guest cluster was leveraging the name of the
VSphereCluster object.
With the advent of ClusterClass, the name of the generated
VSphereCluster object is different than the name of the Cluster object.

This patch adds the logic to get the owner Cluster object from the
VSphereCluster object and use that to generate the name of the secret
that contains the kubeconfig.
It also updates the test logic by passing different name to the Cluster
object.

The MachineSpec.VMTemplate currently is treated as name of

can be duplicated inside a VC, thus we need a more precise
mechanism to point to a VM to be used as a template. For
this purpose we are now allowing the VMTemplate to also
be a valid UUID that would then be matched with the VMs
InstanceUUID property which is guaranteed to be unique.

The modified logic detects if the passed string looks like
a valid UUID then it tried to find the VM by InstaceUUID
if not found, then it fall back on treating the string as
the VM name.

when trying to build we were seeing an error:

invalid version: unknown revision 8c4d5ac76c83`

it seems that the revision is not currently in the vm-operator repo so
we need to pin to a new version.

IPAddressClaims must be fulfilled before a VM can be powered on. This

This patch updates the ready-state logic for the Cluster and Machine
objects. A machine is not marked as ready until it is possible to
connect to the target cluster and verify the machine is represented
there as a node.

Additionally, this patch relocates the code to create the KubeConfig
secret from the Cluster's Reconcile function to the Machine's Update
function. This is because the KubeConfig secret must be created before a
Cluster can verify its ready state. If the Cluster didn't create the
KubeConfig until after it was ready, then a circular dependency would be
created, and a Cluster would never appear as ready.

Finally, several existing calls have been changed to rely on the CAPI
NodeRef/Remote packages in order to get a client for a target cluster

This patch changes the default behavior of waiting for the generation of
a default secret for the service account and propagate that over to the
guest cluster.
Instead, alongwith the service account a secret of type
""kubernetes.io/service-account-token"" is created to host the token for
the service account. The controller waits for the realization of this
secret and then propagates this data over to the guest cluster.

This is required since 1.24 disables the auto generation of a default
token secret for every service account created.

This patch fixes the logic of enqueuing requests to the VSphereCluster
controller when VSphereMachine objects get changed. This is needed since
the name of the Cluster object is different than the name of the
VsphereCluster object in case of topology controller.

It also cleans up the unused GetMachineInCluster() function which can be
replaced by GetFilteredMachinesForCluster() function from the CAPI util
package.

This patch adds support for using kubeadm for bootstrapping onto the new
CAPV images. This is to align CAPV's features with those in CAPA.

Add unit test for GetMachineRole

This patch adds a unit test for GetMachineRole.

Updated CAPI to same version as CAPA

This patch updates the CAPI dependency to the same version used by CAPA.

Update CI provider component logging

This patch sets the log level in the CI provider components file to 6.

Remove unused code in GoVmomi utils

This patch removes unused code in GoVmomit utils.

Centralize API updates

This patch removes the code that updated the taskref from inside the
GoVmomi create callstack. The machines are now only updated as part of a
deferred routine in the actuators.

Return if find VM by moref

This patch returns from the Create call if the VM is found by its MoRef.

Refactored to use Cluster & Machine Contexts

Akin to CAPA's Scopes, this patch introduces support for Cluster &
Machine contexts, making writing code much, much easier, as well as
centralizing all of the boilerplate work that happens at the beginning
and end of each request into the context.

Initialize loggers with actuator IDs

This patch ensures the cluster and machine actuator loggers have the
correct prefix.

Lock the klog library to v0.2.0

Updating the project with support for klogr caused the klog dependency
to be updated to v0.3.1, and that was causing CI to break.

Support disabling validation on gen yaml

This patch adds support for disabling the validation of certain env vars
when generating yaml with generate-yaml.sh

Use CAPI 0.1.3 image

This patch switches to using the CAPI 0.1.3 image due to an error
starting CAPI inside of Kind with the 0.1.2 image. Please see
https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/issues/999 for more
information.

Refactored Actuators, removed informers

This patch refactors the actuators into discreet packages and removed
the use of informers. This patch also relocates the setup code for the
controller into the manager binary's main file.

Update e2e kubectl bin to 1.14.2

This patch updates the kubectl binary used by the e2e job to 1.14.2.

Add SSH auth keys to cloud-init

This patch forwards the ClusterConfig's SSH auth keys list into the
cloud-init data.

Allow a machine to return control plane endpoint

This patch allows a machine to return a control plane endpoint to
satisfy the ProviderDeployer interface. Please see the Slack

During B/R operations, the cluster owner ref is somethimes not present

This patch does the following two things:
- Adds an aggregration rule for the CAPV manager role which can be used
  to add permissions to the manager role on the fly. External clients
  such as addons providers for CPI/CSI can use this label to add
  permissions to the manager dynamically, thereby reducing the need to
  hardcode these permissions in CAPV.
- It also cleans up the patch files to add the CAPI and KCP aggregation
  labels to the CAPV manager role

1) fix e2e.sh with right ${PROW_JOB_ID} name
2) fix sed usage at Makefile, so it works across Mac/Linux

We now check the connectivity regardless of whether
CloudProviderConfiguration is set on the spec.

That property has been deprecated and it is valuable to check this
connectivity early and surface this on the VSphereCluster status rather
than just on VSphereVMs.

This also fixes a bug where the status could be set to ""False"" if the
secret was not found and then never properly set to ""True"" once the secret
becomes present.

This patch exposes the logic which creates/deletes a cluster module
construct for every cluster-api object responsible for creating new
Machine/VSphereVM/K8s node objects. For each such object, CAPV creates a
cluster module which best effort guarantees anti affinity placement of
VMs belonging to this CAPI object on the ESXi hosts.

This patch introduces a new feature flag which gates the anti affinity
functionality.
The name of the feature flag is `NodeAntiAffinity` and can be set/reset by
setting the `EXP_NODE_ANTI_AFFINITY` to true/false.

This patch adds the logic for the deletion of orphaned vspheremachine
objects. Orphaned VSphereMachine objects are those who do not have the
CAPI Machine objects set as their owners. This situation could arise if
the owner CAPI Machine gets deleted before claiming the VSphereMachine
object as its dependent object.
There is a CAPI bug which is supposed to solve this issue, but in the
meanwhile, if the VSPhereMachine does not have any other owner
references apart from the VSphereCluster object, then we delete those
objects during VSphereCluster deletion loop.

On controller startup, the reconciliation loops for the VSphereCluster

created session which gets saved in the cache gets used for future API
calls and the other sessions are left to idle.
Also, altered the logout logic to destroy the session using the govmomi

This patch updates the Makefile to use a custom shell based on
""hack/shell-with-gopath.sh"" to ensure that even when building outside
the GOPATH, K8s tooling will still work.

This patch also:

* Updates any go:generate code to use scripts in ""hack/"" since
go:generate ignores the current, working directory
* Removes the Makefile from ""config/crds"" and puts that logic into
""hack/update-generated.sh"" since recursive Make does not use the custom
shell
* Remove the CRD validation added in
50dc7f0264761df87288f5aeea883c52401521f1. This will be replaced with a
new Prow pre-submit test that will call ""hack/verify-crds.sh""

This patch fixes the one caveat with the approach of a nested GOPATH,
which was that if it was created in or out of a container, either the
host or the container wouldn't work the next time ""make"" was invoked.
This corrects that by checking first to see if the symlink is broken and
recreating it if it is.",73,10,0,0,"2018-08-21 20:53:43","289.21"

The systemd unit definition of the kubelet sources the file
/etc/default/kubelet for any env variables. The default file
generated for /etc/default/kubelet has an empty value like
`KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS=`. This causes the kubelet to not use the
actual value of KUBELET_EXTRA_ARGS set in the override file
/etc/systemd/system/kubelet.service.d/20-cloud.conf

This is the same fix as PR#68 which fixed this issue with master
node. This PR expands the same fix to worker nodes as well

The root issue is without this the kubelet on the node starts
without the `--cloud-provider=vsphere` flag causing the node to
be not recognized as a cloud instance

- IPv4 Gateways from IPAddresses (created by IPAM providers) are
  assigned to the Gateway4 field
- IPv6 Gateways from IPAddresses (created by IPAM providers) are assigned
  to the Gateway6 field
- All gateways in the same IP family assigned to a VSphereVM network

- This implementation expects that an appropriate gateway for the IP
  family exists for every IPAddress that comes from an IPAM provider.
- Adds the `IPAddressClaimed` Condition to provide visibility of the
  status of IP address acquisition
- Adds the finalizer to prevent IPAMClaims from being deleted early
- IPAddressClaims have an OwnerReference to VSphereVMs to ensure they
  are garbage-collected when the VM is deleted.

This patch adds a check for the following when creating cluster modules:
1. If the infra machine template kind used by MD/KCP object points to
   a different template kind (not VSphereMachineTemplate)
2. If the machine clone spec in the VSphereMachineTemplate points to a
   different vCenter URL than the VSphereCluster object. Basically, the
   case where some worker nodes for a cluster are deployed on a
   different vCenter instance.

The conversion-gen command has an --output-base argument to control

can vary depending on whether or not $GOPATH is set or not. This results
in our generated files being created in the wrong place for some people
in a subtle and non-obvious way.

For those running `make generate` with GOPATH set, the files are created
in `$GOPATH/src/[file path]`. For those without GOPATH set, files are
created where we expect them to be within the repo at `./[file path]`.

To make sure files are always generated to the location where we expect
them to be, this updates our calls to conversion-gen to always be
explicit and set `--output-base=./`.

This patch moves the IPAddressClaim creation/update/deletion logic to
the vsphereVM controller.
It also:
- Adds a watcher to IPAddressClaim objects:
  Introduces a watcher on the IPAddressClaim object to enqueue a reconcile
  request for the VSphereVM owner object.
- Reorders Ready condition calculation logic:
  Re-orders the conditions used to geenrate the summary condition on the
  VSphereVM object.
- Adds new ipam sub-package under govmomi pkg:
  This resturctures the logic to check for the bound IP address claims and
  building the corresponding IPAM state which gets passed to the metadata
  reconcile method.

* Add a new machinespec for defining the instance on vsphere

With the new structure we should be able to:
* Support defining multiple nics
* Support providing dhcp/static IP configuration for each nic
* Support customizing multiple disks if present
* Adds a optional flag called ""vsphereCloudInit"" to indicate if
  the template used has the vsphere datasource for cloud-init
  present and enabled

Note: This change does not change the existing behavior of using
the MachineVariables string map. This will be handled in the
subsequent patches.

This patch removes the logic for creating a new ConfigMap
resource for Supervisor VMs. Instead CAPV simply points
the Supervisor resources to the existing CAPI bootstrap
secrets.

Previously Supervisor integration required setting
the ControlPlaneEndpoint value in Cloud-Init metadata.
However, this was recognized as vestigial as the
KubeadmBootstrap controller automatically grabs the
ControlPlaneEndpoint from the
Cluster.Spec.ControlPlaneEndpoint field if the value is
not explicitly specified.

For more information please see the following links:

* The CAPV Cluster reconciler does not proceed until there is a control plane endpoint -- https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/blob/cc735927f7c7671dc8f30bc796474fa62555a127/controllers/vmware/vspherecluster_reconciler.go#L184-L188
* The CAPV Cluster reconciler only marks the Cluster as ""ready"" when there is a valid control plane endpoint -- https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api-provider-vsphere/blob/cc735927f7c7671dc8f30bc796474fa62555a127/controllers/vmware/vspherecluster_reconciler.go#L190

* The CAPI Core KubeadmBootstrap reconciler uses the value of Cluster.Spec.ControlPlaneEndpoint if one is not provided explicitly -- https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/cluster-api/blob/ffee0a45cf823965d6e6d578d93eb3b6730ec734/bootstrap/kubeadm/internal/controllers/kubeadmconfig_controller.go#L925-L931

deprecate(flags): enable-keep-alive flag

The --enable-keep-alive flag is deprecated, since the functionality is now enabled by default.
IN subsequent commits the keep-alive feature's dependence on this flag will be factored out.

refactor: Decouple the keep-alive feature from the flag

With this commit, the deprecated keep-alive feature flag is functionally removed.
All functionality that previously relied on the flag's presence has been
refactored to work without the flag. The CLI flag is still present but marked
deprecated.

chore: Remove keep-alive flag from manager deployment manifest

The deprecated `--enable-keep-alive` is removed from the controller-manager's
deployment manifest.

the union of Debian and RHEL family local hostnames.

We also finally move wholly to systemd to set the hostname.

This fixes a panic that was caused because of a race condition between
the VSphere machine controller creating the VM which was causing another
reconcile event being requeued for the same object. The other reconcile
event was sometimes failing to find the created VSphereVM from the
earlier request and trying to create the same object and failing with an
already exists error.
Now, the VSphereMachine controller omits the create events for the
VSphereVM objects since the controller is the author of those objects
and should not be notified for the same event.

The thought is to skip this test since this test requires a sepcialized
setup and using the CAPI defaults which work for CAPD might not be
suitable for CAPV since provisioning takes slightly longer in vSphere.

This test will need to be reworked to create a HA control plane and then
mark a node for remediation.

This patch updates the way the YAML manifests are generated to no longer
rely on envsubst and instead use Python, a language installed by default
on macOS and nearly all Linux distros. The changes include:

* The generation script is now located at hack/generate-yaml.sh
* The file hack/envsubst.py handles what used to require the gettext
package
* The image hack/tools/kustomize/Dockerfile is a Google distroless image
with the Kustomize tool. This image is only 20MIB in size.
* The generation script defaults to using the Kustomize image over a
local binary, but ""-k local"" can be used to prefer the local binary if
desired
* The manifest templates have been updated to account for API type
