I'm pretty sure this fixes #354

Problem was we were setting two timers for updateClock because of an
update loop stemming from a reaction to our emitted event (which would
finish evaluating before the assignment of our setTimeout), so after
awhile that method could be called with an old clock object and reset
things in a funky way.

This patch also includes a fix for how often to call the clock update
function, we were stomping a common timer value so it wouldn't always
update right on the second as we desire.",120,5,0,1,"2017-02-24 15:33:38","144.24"

The problem was that the machine decides which player to make as the opponent by comparing the relevant player to black and to white, displaying whichever player is not the relevant player. Unfortunately, the ""relevant player"" was being set as the currently logged-in user rather than the player whose profile was being viewed. This caused the display of the wrong opponent in about half of cases.
To fix this, GameLists and GobanLineSummaries no longer have an opponentStyle property, and instead take an optional player property. If the player is undefined or not in the game, then the GameList will list Black and White players. If the player is in the game, then it will display only an Opponent player, which is the player that is not given in the player property.",31,0,0,0,"2017-02-24 15:33:38","10.25"

Heavily configuring Prettier is discouraged, and many of these settings were default anyway.

Reasoning for keeping the 3 settings:

- tabWidth: ESLint and TSLint before that enforced 4 spaces, so changing to 2 would change every line in the codebase.
- trailingComma: default is ES5, but since we are in a TypeScript environment, modern conventions are possible.
- printWidth: While 80 is generally recommended, this repo has heavily indented passages which look horrible on 80.  Hence a wider setting was chosen.  See https://github.com/online-go/online-go.com/pull/1593/files#r777484939",280,58,1,1,"2017-02-24 15:33:38","1776.21"

Each player's profile page displays the rankings of the players using a progress bar style UI element with a number indicating the progress. When the progress is less than 50%, then the number is supposed to be displayed to the right of the progress bar, whereas for more than 50% the number is on top of the progress bar. This ensures that the number doesn't overflow the progress bar element.
In the first case (<50% progress) the bar was invisible. This commit fixes that.",54,1,0,0,"2017-02-24 15:33:38","35.12"

Updated the lists of filtered words and expressions for the German, Italian and Portuguese languages.

The German list is now in alphabetical order, a repeated entry was suppressed, a few unnecessary words were removed and one included according to smurph's suggestions at the Online Go Forum.

The updated Italian list was provided by lysnew, also at the forum.

I updated the Portuguese list myself: removed unnecessary entries and included more commonly used words and expressions plus their usual variations—since some of them include diacritics, I also enabled the u flag in the regular expression.

This ensures that when you log in as a different user, or are not logged
in, you don't see notes from another account.

to transitioning data and preferences to those keyed values, and dealing
with what do we do when we change accounts and transition from being
logged out to logged in and vise versa.

This is a workaround to fix #2406 where a chrome behavior (I say bug)
causes a fetch error to occur if our resized files are larger than
64KiB. All resources I've found on the topic do not mention any such
limit and it's unclear to me why this limit is being imposed, so it
may be a temporary issue in Chrome or it may be something else that I'm
not aware of. Regardless, the change to webp largely resolves the issue,
and scaling images down if they are ""large"" is a fine solution too I
think, so I think the resulting workaround is a desirable behavior
regardless.",1,80,1,1,"2017-02-24 15:33:38","2443.45"

Having eslint run our prettier checks gets us some prettier output in
our gulp build loop window so we know when prettier is failing before a
commit.  The gulp-prettier plugin seemed to do the same but with less
information (no line numbers for instance, although I assume I just
didn't have it configured right), and overall it was slower, probably
because it had to run a full prettier check after a full eslint check,
and either eslint's caching is applied to the prettier checks when
eslint does it, or it's run in parallel, or both, I'm not sure - but
this seemed to be the better option, but I'm open to being corrected.",281,59,1,1,"2017-02-24 15:33:38","1780.92"
