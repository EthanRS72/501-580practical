* add 0134-WebUI-Add-ShowInternalSysvars patch

* modified button translations to better fit existing naming scheme.

* integrated a slight style change to make the action column more compact.

* we use a light gray background to distinguish internal from non-internal
system variables.

* disable Edit button for internal+unerasable sysvars.

* we check for ID_GW_SYSSERVICE and ID_GW_SYSALARM for disabling the edit
button rather than internal&&unerasable

RaspberryPi4 regularly checks if an onboard USB3 port is used together
with a GPIO connected rf module (RPI-RF-MOD/HM-MOD-RPI-PCB) and output a

a RaspberryPi4 is known to produce significant rf interference which
could negatively affect the rf communication and thus a user have to be
warned that the combination of a Pi4+USB+GPIO is not a good idea.
However, for use cases where a user wants to disable that regular
watchdog check a file /etc/config/rpi4usb3CheckDisabled can be
generated. This refs https://homematic-forum.de/forum/viewtopic.php?f=65&t=69421",37,62,1,1

This PR integrates a first-hand implementation for generating docker/container versions of RaspberryMatic. Please note, that this is still partly WIP and not released yet. So if you are testing the docker implementation you are somehwat on your own until we release this to the public.

* reduce duplication in proxy configs

* removed /var/etc/lighttpd_proxy.conf generation and renamed proxy_normal.conf to proxy.conf only.
* commented out ""#server.network-backend"" in lighttpd.conf to use the default settings which should prefer sendfile and thus speed up non-TLS traffic. (cf. https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/pull/1847#issuecomment-1141325120)
* we don't have perl, thus remove the .pl cgi option.
* updated lighttpd 1.4.65 t(e9565b2bb0197e54310e1637813c915fcfe27944) which comes with a new ""url-invalid-utf8-reject"" http parse option in lighttpd which should allow the url normalization to still take place while allowing to have iso-8859-1 encoded percentage encoding in URLs (cf. https://github.com/jens-maus/RaspberryMatic/issues/1831#issuecomment-1136366509)
* enable server.graceful-restart-bg http opt lighttpd 1.4.65 allows for a graceful restart via SIGUSR1 in S50lighttpd.
* removed sleep 2 in S50lighttpd reload() function which is not necessary due to the graceful restart possibility.
