This can save **a lot** of etherscan queries for when decoding
transactions of a block with many internal transactions.

Before, in order to find internal transactions of a transaction we
used to query for the same block's internal transactions.

That added a lot of extra queries, as a block can have many many
transactions, each with their own internal transactions, and all were
pulled, since an internal transaction's parent is also pulled when the
internal is pulled.

This is easily solved since etherscan has recently added a query for internal
transactions of a transaction hash.",65,60,1,1

While working on 1.29.1 and the new encrypted DB backup upload
mechanism we noticed that for some unstable connections and big DB
backup sizes a timeout can happen and the DB upload fails.

After a lot of debugging it was noticed that a read timeout of a
socket happens here:
https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/blob/f96a1cfc568beddf1e17ce7609609eca40780be5/src/urllib3/connectionpool.py#L785

A bit further down the HTTP request has a retry check:
https://github.com/urllib3/urllib3/blob/f96a1cfc568beddf1e17ce7609609eca40780be5/src/urllib3/connectionpool.py#L865

This is what this commit takes advantage of. Sets the requests session
for rotki.com in a way that we have at least 3 retries for all failed
requests.

The way the arguments are setup is also required as the retry
increment function checks against each different error type and
method:

We had a potential bug which could have been the culprit for botched
user DB upgrades of some of our users.

Before all DB upgrading start we were applying the latest sqlite table
creation. Which is very wrong for the case of old upgrades. If the
user is starting a very old upgrade. Say from v2 to v26 then v2 would
start with the DB being populated with all the new tables with foreign
key relations. And it is bound to fail somewhere along the way from 2
to 26. Happened in tests, which is how I noticed it.

Switched to:

- First doing all upgrades (assuming there is a DB - if not a new one
is created in next step)
- Then applying latest tables creation.

Had to adjust tests quite a bit.

And also important. Now each update that relies on tables that were
added during table creation needs to also add said tables during the
upgrade. Thanks to the tests it was easy to spot those and fix them.",241,42,1,1

That fixture was not useful and was in fact broken. It became obvious
when I tried to use it. We can't have a different globalDB fixture for
session and a different for function scope in tests.

The reason being it's a singleton and the function one will modify the
session one. So things get mixed up pretty badly causing undefined
behaviour. Which can hit you when running tests with ""trying to
operate on a closed DB"" if the cleanup of the function scope globalDB
is done before a new test and a session scope fixture needing session
globalDB tries to read it.

Generally bad idea",7,67,1,1

A user reported to us that the app was freezing for him after loading a huge pnl report.
By reading the logs it took around 4 mins for the endpoint to return a value. The reasons for
the issue where:

1. The reports endpoint is called sync and not async
2. It was performing a heavy sql query fetching the size of the reports

This was blocking the backend from receiving any other request and also making as if no report
was getting generated since it was not being displayed on the frontend.

We discussed in discord and didn't see any meaningful reason to have it so we are removing the size
on disk info for now.",48,63,1,1

When resolving an asset via `resolve()` the returned resolved asset, has the
normalized identifier. But when checking for asset existence with
`check_existence()` the asset can be seen to be in the DB but its
identifier will not be normalized.

This can result to all the following assets moving around in our
codebase: Asset('ETH'), Asset('eth'), Asset('eTh'), Asset ('etH')
etc. While the normalized identifier is 'ETH'.

This hit us recently in the icons query, where the frontend was
sending us 'eth' instead of 'ETH', and this was seen as a valid asset,
but its icon filepath was not found in Linux since it expected
""$ICON_DIR/eth_small.png"" but did not find it. What's interesting is
that this works fine for Mac and Windows since filepaths there are
case insensitive.",41,65,1,1

The reason was that the code for the exchange was expecting the key `ftx_subaccount_name`

around the code.

Fix #5052

At _update_history_event_assets_identifiers_to_caip_format it was
possible that a history event contained an asset which was missing
from the assets table.

Since the DB upgrade modifies the history_events table to enforce it
so that assets are connected to the assets table this upgrade can
break if for some reason an asset is missing from the asset table.

To fix it we catch the exception and use it to simply add the asset to
the assets table before re-attempting the history event insertion",101,56,1,1

This commit removes:

- Eth2 deposits API
- Eth2 deposits DB table
- Makes sure the table is deleted during the upgrade.
- Gets the pubkey to deposit address from decoded events instead but
  in a hacky way

Also adds the following to v36 test DB so DB upgrade can be tested:
```
INSERT INTO used_query_ranges(name, start_ts, end_ts) VALUES(""eth2_deposits_0x9531C059098e3d194fF87FebB587aB07B30B1306"", 0, 10);

Fix #519.

This should no longer happen. The very first upgrade of the DB turned
all address entries into checksummed entries. Since then we make sure
to always add addresses as checksummed in the DB and the API also
makes sure that all address input is checksummed.

So this commit closes the chapter by warning the user if a
non-checksummed eth account is found in his DB. But the only way this
happens is if the user manually edits it.",58,21,0,1

Specifically:

> So why do we retry this, using the promise-retry module? The reason is very important, and we will see the same thing happening in the rest of the test — when we ask the browser to do something, like navigating to a URL, the browser will do it, but asynchronously. D>

> Unfortunately, if you do not retry in this case, it could still work, because the browser is very fast. But try running it in a CI system like Travis, as I did, and you may get a failure, because CI-s are usually slower than your local system.

According to https://docs.python.org/3/whatsnew/3.2.html#optimizations
since Python 3.2 constant literal collections are automatically loaded
as a frozen set at compile time which make their loading time

So at that point it's suggested to replace constant collections of
list/tuples with sets as set IN comparison is faster.

Used ruff's https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/rules/literal-membership/ for
this but had to be very careful and only accept constant literal
suggestions. Since it suggests all IN collection checks to have this

> Whether the name can be used to open the file a second time, while the

That means that in Windows the temporary file is opened once at the
context manager, stays open and when it's attempted to be opened by
sqlcipher as a DB it goes BOOM BOOM.

The solution for this to work on all platforms is to explicity close
it to allow reopening, to not delete file when closing and to do

The problem that was noticed was an interesting one in an old laptop.

The assets in the global DB were quite old. About a year old. When
initializing the global DB upgrade worked fine. But then when
initializing the inquirer BSQ resolution failed since it did not exist
in the DB and as such the entire app crashes and could not open.

That shows that the approach with the resolution is rather brittle and
will need at least in some places rethinking.

But the solution is simple. Move the BSQ resolution only where it's
used. And warn the user very clearly if the 2 base assets USD and WETH
are removed.",97,56,1,1

Fix #2178

The code before was assuming that if the local size is less than the
remote size we should ask the user if they want to pull the remote
data and replace local.

Which is fine in some cases but should not happen if you only use one
system and one rotki instance. Yet it was happening since if you say
remove an ethereum account a lot of data is removed from the DB.

And with less data in the local DB rotki asks if it should pull from
remote. From now on we only deal with timestamp for this prompt of the
DB sync at start.",218,44,1,1

5. Exit critical section, re-enabling the callback
6. Context switch back to the progress callback of (1) and exit it.
7. Segmentation fault.

semaphore. And going into a write cursor is essentially entering the

This is important as after conversations with etherscan engineers I

Unfortunately the previous approach here:
https://github.com/rotki/rotki/pull/6058 was not tested and as such
was not a solution.

The problem happens only at detaching from the packaged DB and only
when there is an active transaction for the same connection.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/56243770/sqlite3-detach-database-produces-database-is-locked-error

So the approach I followed was to guard with the transaction lock when
we try to detach a DB.

What was happening is the following:

1. Get in the progress callback but before the in_callback lock is acquired.
2. Wait for the lock acquisition and context switch out
.A lot of things happen and the callback gets entered by a lot of other sections
and has the lock acquired. Some of those places do connection.commit
and modify the connection. As per the docs that's a no no.
https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/progress_handler.html
4. We context switch back to the original callback acquire the lock
and then release it and the callback is exited.
Since the connection has been modified KABOOM SEGFAULT.

The way around this is:

1.To also acquire the callback lock before connection
modifications. So before commit and rollback.
2. If we get in the callback and see that the lock is acquired we do
not wait for it. Instead we exit the callback immediately. This
guarantees that in the case this happens we will not context switch
and exit the callback with the connection having been modified. We
just exit immediately so no modifications can ever happen so long as
we are in the callback.",96,53,1,1

* Fix 1145
* Adds an Exchange Balances sub-page to Accounts & Balances where one can view asset balances by exchange. Clicking an exchange link in the dashboard now takes you here. The old views/ExchangeBalances component and associated route has been removed.
* Splits Accounts & Balances into three pages corresonding to balance source (Exchanges / Blockchain / Manual) via tabbed navigation and adds corresponding routes
* Moves Adding and Editing of balances/accounts to a common component using a wrapper (BigDialog). BigDialog is a large card that comes up from the bottom of the window and has more space than a normal dialog modal.
* Touches up some UI elements in the asset details for blockchain balances (makes the buttons for ""expand/contract"" buttons that are circles, fixes gutters, right-aligns figures).

* Fix 1154 Fixes tags filter behavior in manual balances
* Fixes some CSS in the TagFilter so that the tag box doesn't fluctuate in height when you add/clear tags

* Fix 1140
* Fixes sorting in the asset balances to use the label or address (if no label is present).
* Blockchain addresses are now truncated.
* Blockchain addressed are now blurred if privacyMode is enabled.",151,28,1,0

- In 1.27.0 a bug was introduced where new DBs that were created (or
any DBs that needed no migration ran -- but that is only new DBs) did
not write anything in the DB for last_migration_version. This means
that even if there came a new version, like from this commit, they
would not actually apply it. Fixed it so that even if no migrations
run the last data migration version of the current rotki version is
written in the DB

- Introducing migration version 9. This is to address
https://github.com/rotki/rotki/issues/5560. The issue here was that
all history events for on-chain transactions have location:
Blockchain. Any they contain no way to identify the chain. With this
migration we add a location for Ethereum and a location for
Optimism. And then we check all history events, check the
corresponding transaction hash and the chain it is in and adjust the
location accordingly. Having just general location blockchain was a
useless field in the past.",57,59,1,1

I am assuming we had it there in case the assets update changes an

In this case, for this upgrade we update this cache during the user DB
upgrade and no identifiers change during global DB upgrade, so
removing it from here is the correct option.

But we would probably need to think of when we would need to purge
this table in the future.",101,55,1,1

Ethereum transactions are now also saved in the database.

Initially for each address in a time range we first check if the last
DB trade is at the limit of the range. If yes then that means the
range has been queried before succesfully and then we do not query
again.

Else we query etherscan and save the transactions in the DB.

The logic needs more finetuning, and needs to be made similar to the
rest of the DB + API querying logic, but unfortunately etherscan
querying uses block numbers and not timestamps. Converting between
timestamps and block numbers is non trivial.",55,19,0,1

We started using the ""closest"" argument of getblocknobytime in
etherscan and had tried to use ""before"" for from timestamps and
""after"" for to timestamps so we get the biggest range possible.

The problem with this approach is that if asking to get block for up to the
current timestamp and giving ""after"", then etherscan errors out
instead of returning the latest block number. So for now we keep the
functionality as it was before with ""before"". If they fix it, or if we
change it and add extra checks (probably too complicated?) we can undo

After introducing ruff we added a pyproject.toml file and this changed the default

The reason to keep that file is that we do an editable install (pip install -e .) that
allows us to call the rotkehlchen module after modifications without needing to install
it again.

This kind of install is allowed with setuptools but from version 64 and we are in 60.7.1
because pyinstaller requires it.

later study how to update setuptools if possible and then move the content of the setup.py

Fix #5038

What was happening is at some very rare case we were getting into the
`maybe_upload_db` through two different greenlets.

Mind you this should not happen easily. Instead of putting a lock as
the task can't be scheduled at the same time and it can only happen if
both a user presses to push to server and the periodic task happen at
the same time we just protect it if it does happen.

We do that by making sure the name is unique each time. Before
`TemporaryDirectory()` was always returning the same directory, we
were trying the same filename for the DB in the directory and then
BOOM.

We fix this by using a uniquely named temporary file each time.",98,56,1,1

Description of the error:
1. I tried to log in to a database that has an invalid schema due to being partially migrated.
2. https://github.com/rotki/rotki/blob/0fa9a7cc2dee688db0621750a31b2c6c49c31108/rotkehlchen/rotkehlchen.py#L268 worked and the exchanges were initialized
3. Then later the log in failed BUT the exchange list didn't clean.
4. I attempted to log in with a database that was fine
5. since the exchange manager already had the exchange initialized the data handler stored in the intialized exchanges was to a disconnected database.

Also a side effect of this was double balances in exchanges since I had initialized exchanges again later (this time with the correct database)

- For db/settings.py though it can be splinto db/settings/structure.py
and db/settings/cache.py the easiest way is to just reduce the surface
of imports that import whole files by moving the constants to their
own dedicated files as it should always be with organized code.

- The long standing get_current_version() + Github() circular import
hit again here, so decided to fix it for good, by rearranging the way
the function works in a way that Github is passed to it only in the 1
place that we want to check for updates. All other places dont need it
so importing it is also not needed.",42,64,1,1

Their API is the shittiest shit out there. Time and time again it has
proven to be the most incompetent, least technical and worst
maintained API of all centralized exchanges.

In the latest installment of their continuous incompetence the fiat
payments endpoint (https://binance-docs.github.io/apidocs/spot/en/#get-fiat-payments-history-user_data)
seems to be a special case in the way it returns data with an empty list.
It may omit the data key completely and return something like this:
{'code': '000000', 'message': 'success', 'success': True, 'total': 0}
which breaks the expectations of our binance api parser and goes
against their own docs.

Worked a bit more on the VCR setup fixture, trying to make it a linear
process checking some things and logging its behaviour while working
okay both locally and in the CI.

So the process is roughly now like:

1. Get test caching root dir and clone if needed
2. Try to checkout test-caching of the same branch as rotki
3. If that does not work try GITHUB_BASE_REF (PR target branch) or
default to develop (or DEFAULT_VCR_BRANCH)
4. Fetch origin changes
5. If there is uncomitted work do not change do not change anything.
6. If the local branch is ahead of the remote, do not change anything.
7. If you reach the end reset to origin's branch version (to update it)",58,59,1,1

Made some changes so that all asset searches api endpoints ignore all
ignored assets during search.

Also removed the old `get_ignored_assets` function as it was really
heavy-handed.

It used to get all ignored asset ids, turn them into Assets (so for
each ignored asset, that is a roundtrip to the global DB) and then if
that does not work even delete it from the user DB.

Replaced it with a simple function fetching the identifiers of the
ignored assets and its usage with the new function everywhere.

Perhaps it would make sense to also have either a periodic query, or
an one-off function at DB start to do the removal of unknown assets
from the ignored assets. But in another commit/PR.",61,59,1,1

Should fix #1759 for the problem that a user reported where inputting
an xpub from scratch gets all addresses but deriving addresses from
xpub over time does not.

The problem seems to be that we derive the initial addresses at Rotki
and then any non-used addresses from the derived ones are never seen
again since the highest derived index is taken.

The solution is to start re-derivation from the highest consecutive
index only, not the highest index in total. This way we should not
miss any addresses.",240,34,1,1

This commit moves the core logic of aggregating per-module evm
accountants into a base class for all evm chains.

Then two different classes are instantiated. One for Ethereum and one
for Optimism. The reason for this is:

1. Each accountant also gets passed the inquirer class of the chain so
it can query things on-chain if it needs to. This would probably make
more sense only if there is archive capability.
2. Subclassing instead of generating two EvmAccountingAggregator
instances with different arguments is due to the potential of having
different logic per evm chain, just like we do with the decoders themselves.",88,58,1,1

We are using multicall contract in the ENS queries to obtains ENS names for addresses. The problem that
we observed is that when the number of addresses is high (I tested it with 73) the url of the call to
the nodes was so long that it failed to make the request. The solution I propose chunks the query arguments
to the multicall contract to avoid such urls. I've tried different chunk sizes and 20 was the biggest that made
the query work.

Also I've avoided to repeat the same logic for the `multicall_2` contract since we don't use it in a way that
the logic breaks in the same way and could affect the speed of some queries.",125,51,1,1
