When building LittlevGL with a rather recent compiler (tested with GCC
7.3.1 provided by Arm), `-Wall`, `-Wextra` and `-Werror` activated and
`LV_LOG_LEVEL` set to `LV_LOG_LEVEL_TRACE`, compilation fails due to a
type limits error in lv_log.c

     if(level >= LV_LOG_LEVEL) {
              ^~

because the comparison is always true, since level is a `lv_log_level_t`
(that is a typedef for `uint8_t`) and `LV_LOG_LEVEL_TRACE` equals 0.

Fix that by making `lv_log_level_t` a typedef to `int8_t`.

The issue is related to the case when the indicator is short but the main part (bg) clips it with a larger radius.
In this case this indicaotr might have a strange shape, like
 _
/ |
| |
\_|

We can't draw a shadow like this, so the indicator has to be et least a square,
to be sure it's not clipped to an ugly shape.

The previous code considered the bg radius to decide whether to draw shadow on short indicators or not.
However if the indicator's radius should be considered, becuse if its area at least a square
we can already draw shadows.",23,67,1

This change introduces new fields on `lv_disp_drv_t` that allow to
specify the size of the full display and the offset of the display
subsection that is being rendered to. The values are used to transform
the drawing area before calling `flush_cb` so that only the desired part
of the full display is being rendered to.

* feat(pxp/vglite) Attach NXP GPUs to the new draw context.

Create a single NXP draw layer on top of PXP and VGLITE.
Extra changes:
1. Add VGLITE image blits acceleration.
2. Reenable blit split workaround for quality issue in RT500.
3. Increase threshold from 32 to 5000 px to fill/blit with both PXP and VGLITE.
4. Allow to enable both PXP and VGLITE. Add a fallback mechanism:
- by default the PXP will try to accelerate. if that is not supported (or fails
due to threshold limit condition from 3.) then it will fallback to VGLITE.
- if VGLITE does not support that feature (or fails due to threshold limit
condition from 3.) the it will fallback to CPU.

* feat(vglite) Add VGLITE support to draw arcs.

Use up to 4 bezier curves to optimize the drawing of an arc.
The arc curve has to be constant when growing the angle:
for this we compute sub-arc based on a best approximation of quarter-arc.
use dichotomy to find the sub-arc 't' param, instead of tangent approximation.

Simplify the two steps process by adding the blit_cover and blit_opa functions.

In order to rotate or recolor with opacity, two steps must be fallowed:
1. Run the operation without opa.
2. Blend the result by applying the opa.

* fix(pxp) Separate blit simple by the blit with transformation.

While we run into blit with transformation we have to
decide if the operation needs to be done in one or two steps.
Blit with color format (opa or alpha or chroma key) - require one step: blit_cf().
Blit with rotate or recolor but no color format - require one step: blit_cover().
Blit with rotate or recolor + opa or alpha - require two steps:
blit_opa() = blit_cover() + blit_cf().
Blit with rotate or recolor + chroma key - not supported yet.

* fix(nxp) Fallback to software callbacks if need for argb8565 support.

During rendering, LVGL might initializes new draw_ctxs and start drawing into
a separate buffer (called layer). If the content to be rendered has ""holes"",
e.g. rounded corner, LVGL temporarily sets the disp_drv.screen_transp flag.
It means the renderers should draw into an ARGB buffer.
With 32 bit color depth it's not a big problem but with 16 bit color depth
the target pixel format is ARGB8565 which is not supported by the GPU.
In this case, the NXP callbacks should fallback to SW rendering.

* Add option to align title text in window 

I found that i really needed a basic way to align the title text in a window, and therefore i did a bit of tinkering and came up with this solution. Mind you that I'm very new to this so it might not be the most optimal way. I have tested a bit and it pretty looked promising,
I have of course written the alignments as I felt was most suitable, but I shouldn't be the judge of that.
Current alignment:

LV_TXT_FLAG_CENTER makes the text align in the center of the header but ensures it can’t overextend into to header button area;

LV_TXT_FLAG_RIGHT makes the text align at the right side, but takes the right side header buttons into account

LV_TXT_FLAG_FIT & LV_TXT_FLAG_EXPAND I wasn’t too sure about what to do so as of now it just aligns them as normal

LV_TXT_FLAG_NONE Is equal to no flag set by the user and therefore I have just set it to the default coords, like normal. The text then align at the left side.

* Update lv_win.h

* Added functions

Added function to set and get alignment of the header title as requested

* Added functions

Added setter and getter functions for the header title alignment as requested",21,54,1

As a positive side effect, this also prevents the default ""text"" from
displaying when NULL is passed as the title.

* Corrected bug in styles of labels with selections

Text selection color (text_selection_color) property was incorrectly
being applied to the text color if there was a selection. The sel_color
property in the label descriptor was initialized to blue. This property
was intended to be the label background color under a selection.

* Add new property for the color of selected text

New property for labels: text_sel_font_color
This property will change the color of the font within selected text.

* Rename text selection color properties

Per feedback from issue #1820, sel_color is now sel_bg_color and
sel_font_color is now sel_color. This results in clearer naming.

* PXP: Added basic PXP acceleration

PXP accelerated features:
 - fill (+ opacity)
 - BLIT (+ opacity)
 - recoloring (+ opacity)
 - color keying (+ opacity)

Recoloring + color keying simultaneously not supported.

Signed-off-by: Jozef Bastek <jozef.bastek@nxp.com>

* PXP: Added abstraction for interrupt handling

Previous imlpementation used IRQ polling on PXP, which doesn't allow
real CPU offload. Therefore added set of callbacks for interrupt
handling that should be implemented by user, with possible RTOS
integration.

Default/example implementation of callbacks for bare metal and FreeRTOS
provided (lv_gpu_nxp_pxp_osa.c), enabled by
LV_USE_GPU_NXP_PXP_DEFAULT_OSA switch, accesible via pxp_default_cfg
structure.

Signed-off-by: Jozef Bastek <jozef.bastek@nxp.com>

* PXP: Optimized cache flushing

Previous implementation flushed areas of (LCD width * object height)
size. Cache flush is expensive operation and flushing line by line,
smallest possible area, boost performance by shortening time spent on
cache flushes.

Signed-off-by: Jozef Bastek <jozef.bastek@nxp.com>

* PXP: Added documentation for NXP PXP accelerator

Signed-off-by: Jozef Bastek <jozef.bastek@nxp.com>

* PXP: added missing extern c in header files

Signed-off-by: Jozef Bastek <jozef.bastek@nxp.com>

* PXP: Fixed ifdefs - Removed LV_USE_GPU, fixed internal config

LV_USE_GPU is not intended as a global GPU enable switch. It's used only
for gpu_blend_cb and gpu_fill_cb callbacks, which are obsolete. This
patch removes LV_USE_GPU dependency for PXP code, so it's enabled only
with LV_USE_GPU_NXP_PXP symbol.

Added missing symbols to internal conf, so automatic testd can pass
build step.

Signed-off-by: Jozef Bastek <jozef.bastek@nxp.com>

* PXP: Default OSA changed to PXP auto-initialization

Auto init feature added so if user run FreeRTOS or bare-metal, no PXP
Init code is required. Renamed symbol to be more clear.

Signed-off-by: Jozef Bastek <jozef.bastek@nxp.com>

* PXP: Documentation moved to docs repo

Signed-off-by: Jozef Bastek <jozef.bastek@nxp.com>

* PXP: Fixed alpha configuration

- Coverity issue: AS blend config used uninitialized structure. No
impact on functionality, as blend module is not used (porter-duff blends
in this case)
- Alpha config fixed - swapped alpha values produced different result
from SW render

* Convert tests/Makefile to a cmake project file.

This change switches the building of LVGL tests to use cmake
which is more portable than make. Additionally, whenever
cmake can be used, instead of the Python script (`main.py`),
the former is preferred.

The interface to `main.py` is unchanged, and tests are built
and executated the same as before.

This closes https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/issues/2474.

* Installing `gcovr` in GitHub workflow.

* Documented steps to install libpng-dev.

* Added missing stdout flush when running tests.

* Grammar tweak in README.

Create one GitHub workflow job for each build option build
or test execution. This allows each of the five builds to
be executed in parallel as well as making it easier to
navigate to the test output as it now resides in its own
job.

This change **does** change the command-line arguments to
the test execution script. This is required to allow the
build options name to be passed in.

New `tests/main.py` command-line help:

```
usage: main.py [-h] [--build-options BUILD_OPTIONS] [--clean]
               [--report]
               [{build,test} [{build,test} ...]]

Build and/or run LVGL tests.

positional arguments:
  {build,test}          build: compile build tests, test:
                        compile/run executable tests.

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --build-options BUILD_OPTIONS
                        the build option name to build or run.
                        When omitted all build configurations
                        are used.
  --clean               clean existing build artifacts before
                        operation.
  --report              generate code coverage report for
                        tests.

This program builds and optionally runs the LVGL test programs.
There are two types of LVGL tests: ""build"", and ""test"". The
build-only tests, as their name suggests, only verify that the
program successfully compiles and links (with various build
options). There are also a set of tests that execute to verify
correct LVGL library behavior.

It was difficult to handle the pressed angle on the arc when it crossed the 360 degree boundery.
The solution is to handle the angle relative to the bg_start_angle. This way no angle can be larger than 360.
The other issue was the case when a smaller than min. or larger than max. angle was pressed.
It is handled by introducing 'min_close' flag which stores which end is closer on the last valid press
and prefer this end in uncleary situation.",23,53,1

A direct to task notification is an event sent directly to a task, rather than
indirectly to a task via an intermediary object such as a queue, event group or semaphore.
Sending a direct to task notification to a task sets the state of the target task
notification to 'pending'. Just as a task can block on an intermediary object such
as a semaphore to wait for that semaphore to be available, a task can block on a task
notification to wait for that notification's state to become pending.

Unblocking an RTOS task with a direct notification is 45% faster and uses less RAM
than unblocking a task using an intermediary object such as a binary semaphore.

RTOS task notifications can only be used when there is only one task that can be the recipient of the event.

* Refactor unit test scripts.

Does the following:

1. Remove as many dependencies on the operating system shell as possible.
   For example, use of shutil.rmtree(...) instead of os.system('rm -r ...').
   This brings this script a bit closer to being able to run on Windows.
2. Switch from os.system() to subprocess.check_call().
   * This is a bit more secure as check_call() directly invokes the subprocess
     without evaluation the arguments on a command-line.
   * Removes the need to evaluate the return code as check_call() does this.
   * Can directly set environment variables (e.g. env=cmd_env) instead of
     including with subprocess invocation (e.g. BIN=test.bin).
3. Minor cleanup to main.py sys.argv parsing.
4. PEP8 formatting.

* Ignore FileNotFoundError for rmtree('report').

* Back to os.system for gcovr.

* Removed unused shutil import.",23,62,1

* Fixes for MP support for LVGL 3rd party libraries

Add missing lv_qrcode_class

Remove 'struct JDEC' from public API. This struct is needed intenally on tjpgd.c and lv_sjpg.c, but doesn't need to be exposed in the public API. When exposed, it increases Micropython binding program size and some fields are not supported today (uint8_t* huffbits[2][2]). To overcome this, moved it to a new H file which is not included in public API, only in sjpg C files

Related: https://github.com/lvgl/lv_binding_micropython/issues/180

* lv_qrcode: add lv_class_qrcode

Must define a distinct class for every widget, to allow Micropython bindings convert lv_obj_t into the specific class

* gifdec.c: fix uninitialized

ESP32 reports some potentially uninitialized variables. Initialize them to prevent the errors

* src/extra/libs/sjpg: smaller public header

Only keep lv_split_jpeg_init in public header, since JPEG is used with image decoder

* Remove tjdec.h",18,64,1

includes updates coming from NXP MCU SDK 2.10 with adaptation for lvgl v8:

Fixed BLIT offset computation

Previous implementation didn't take into account a possibility of
non-zero offset in source image, so output was wrong if offset was used.
With this fix, CPU and VG-Lite output is the same even with offsets.

Signed-off-by: Jozef Bastek <jozef.bastek@nxp.com>

gpu: vglite: Buffer sync with BLITs

Added buffer synchronisation with BLITs instead of memcpy for VG-Lite.
In LVGL v8, buffer synchronisation acceleration is moved to littlevgl_support.c.

Signed-off-by: Jozef Bastek <jozef.bastek@nxp.com>

gpu: vglite: Fixed BLIT boundary

Fixed artifact issue revealed by buffer sync with BLIT feature. Caused
by wrong BLIT boundary.

Signed-off-by: Jozef Bastek <jozef.bastek@nxp.com>

gpu: vglite: BLIT quality degradation workaround for RT595

Limitation in RT595 causes BLIT image quality degradation when
coordinates are above 368 px. This patch implements workaround that will
break the BLIT into multiple smaller BLITs, so the quality is not
affected for higher resolutions.

Signed-off-by: Jozef Bastek <jozef.bastek@nxp.com>

gpu: vglite: Fix address alignment and stride requirements

Fixed multiple issues:
- The VGLite alignment requirement checks for the pixel destination
buffer are not applicable in our case of Linear (non-tiled) format.
- Some VGLite stride requirement requirement should be expressed in bytes,
not in pixels.
- Fix the Y alignment function to ensure that line starts at an address
that the respects the alignment requirement of VG-Lite.

Such mistakes do not break application,
but cause a fallback to non-accelerated Blit by CPU.
See MGG-741.

gpu: vglite: fix some MISRA C 2012 violations

fixed 56 violations: mainly implicit format casts
and unchecked returned values.
