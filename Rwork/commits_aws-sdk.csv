Detect errors on the NodeHttp2Handler, immediately destroy
connections on unexpected error mode, and reconnect.

Prior to this PR, if the server sent the client a GOAWAY frame,
the session would not be removed from the connection pool and requests
would fail indefinitely.

This tries to avoid keeping streams (requests) on the Http2Session
(tcp connection) from being stuck in an open state waiting for a gentle
close even if there were unexpected protocol or connection errors
during the request, assuming http2 errors are rare.
(if a server or load balancer or network is misbehaving,
close() might get stuck waiting for requests to finish,
especially if requests and sessions don't have timeouts?)

This change implements the core functionality of HttpRequest for SRA.
New properties were added to the HttpRequest class, old properties
and interfaces were deprecated. Proxy was added for headers and query
properties to maintain backward compatibility. This change does not
include updates to the SDK to use new functionality.

Notes on other changes:
* middleware-host-header and middleware-sdk-transcribe-streaming tests:
  URL.port always returns '' if port is set to the default for the
protocol.
* middleware-sdk-transcribe-streaming: Providing URL.hostname with a
  string containing the port number does not update the port.
* signature-v4 prepareRequest: See comment in code.
* Field: toString method was changed to only require double quotes on
  values with commas. Current tests allow spaces without double quotes.
* Fields: Helper methods were added for getting all fields and creating
  a Fields object.

Additional notes:
* When converting between single string header values and a list of
  field values, split("","") and join("","") are used to avoid making any
modifications to the original value, preserving compatibility.
* HttpRequest.isInstance was not modified, because doing so might break
  compatibility. The check was not looking for the clone method, so
wasn't actually verifying the object was indeed an instance. The method
could easily have been used on a HttpRequest interface from the types
package, and returned true.",111,71,1,0

Implements DNS caching for `NodeDnsLookupHostResolver`, including:

- internal `DnsCache` interfaces
- implementation of the cache with `HostEntryTable`
- updated `NodeDnsLookupHostResolver` to use `DnsCache`

The cache hierarchy is as follows:

- `HostEntryTable` maps host name (string) -> `HostEntry`
- `HostEntry` contains good and failed records for IPv4 and IPv6 addresses in a
  `HostAddressEntryCollection`
- `HostAddressEntryCollection` is used for LRU behavior, and stores `HostAddress` with expiration
  timestamps

The address cache workflow is as follows for `NodeDnsLookupHostResolver.resolveAddress()`:

- If there was no previous DNS resolution for a host name, create a new DnsCacheEntry with new
  addresses
- If there was a previous DNS resolution already cached:
  - Update with a new DNS resolution with new addresses if the next-time-to-update timestamp is
    reached
  - Otherwise, noop
- Process the records by removing expired addresses (except 1 address of each type in case of a DNS
  outage)
  - May promote a non-expired failed address if there are no good addresses
- Return the first available IPv4 and IPv6 addresses, and append them to the end of the internal
  DnsCacheEntryCollection as the most recently used addresses.
  - Will throw an error if no addresses are available",138,70,1,0

This change takes the first header value from x-amzn-errortype
if multiple headers are provided.

An example curl output for a response that this works for:
```
HTTP/2 401
date: Tue, 09 Aug 2022 21:24:20 GMT
content-type: application/json
content-length: 92
x-amzn-requestid: xxxx
access-control-allow-origin: *
x-amzn-errortype: UnauthorizedError
x-amzn-errortype: UnauthorizedException
x-amz-apigw-id: xxxx
x-amzn-trace-id: Root=xxxx
```
In this instance this code will select the first header value.

This commit updates the support for aws.rest-json-1.1 to build atop
the refactor of protocol generation done in smithy-typescript. It
also introduces support for the aws.rest-json-1.0 protocol.

In doing so, general components were built atop the abstractions
provided. The aws.rest-json-1.* set of protocols serialize BigInteger
and BigDecimal shapes as JSON numbers on the wire, so an implementation
of the DocumentMemberSerVisitor was created to fail generation.
Implementations of the [DocumentShape[Deser|Ser]Visitor classes are
also included to support serde of shapes in request and response
bodies.

A rest-json implementation of the HttpBindingProtocolGenerator has been
created to combine the above aspects and handling of document bodies.",39,31,0,0

It is not relative as we are moving to conposition configuration, and

Address: https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/pull/94

* feat: complete PoC composable configuration

* feat: change config resolver to multiple client config components

* feat: rename stack finalize step to finalizeRequest

* feat: add use() to smithy client to inject middleware

* fix: rename resolvedruntime configuration

* fix: remove exported reviouslyResolved interface

* feat: add metadatabearer to shapes

* feat: parse derializing utils as parameters

* use config interface as middleware parameter
* use smithy command as super class of all commands so we can support use() in commands

* feat: parse serialize(deserialize) util functions from client config

* Serializers/Deserializers should take utils functions from client config
first, if not available then fallback to generated dependencies. This
allows configuring the runtime dependencies manually from client config when
runtime-specific bundlers' decision is not accountable

* docs: add documentation for config properties

* feat: add defaultUserAgen config

* feat: move some config components to middleware folder

The lower level stacks than throw anything to retry strategy in
practice, so casting them to SdkError type is unsafe. With this
change the retryStrategy will do best effort to convert the
thrown any object to SdkError and then supply to retryDecider
and so on.

Another change is making SdkError type more general. It previously
requires $fault, $metadata, which is obviously incorrect. Error
thrown by SDK itself never contains these keys. So I mark them
optional. Granted this is a breaking change to function interface
like RetryDecider, but anyone depending it being required should
already fail anyway.

When sending the same command multiple times, resolveMiddleware()
will be called many times. So adding serde middleware will throw
error because they are already added into stack. This change
prevents adding the serde middleware repeatedly.

Alternative is moving command middleware to the command constructor,
just like in client(that's why client doesn't have the problem). But
the command middleware also have depdency over client configs
supplied from resolveMiddleware(). So serde middleware and
customizations must live here.

The HTTP request class doesn't have any implementations to insure
case-insensitivity of the http headers. So we need to be mindful
when populating these headers. Otherwise, the reqeust signature
will be messed up. This change will ensure the protocol-specific
default headers like content-type will be overriden by the serialized
header if exists.

For other headers added through middleware stack either by
customization or users, it wouldn't affect signing or sending as long
as the request doesn't contain same header names in different casing.
All the internal headers will be consistent. But users should be
careful when they are adding their own headers.

We don't add middleware to lowercase all headers to prevent
alternating the users' customizations.

### Description
Merges implementations of util-stream-browser and util-stream-node into a single package, util-stream.
The implementations were left unchanged, but some adjustments were made to the `package.json` to
accommodate both implementations, and in the jest config to test the browser implementation.

### Testing
- In `packages/util-stream`: `yarn test`
- In `clients/client-s3`: 
  - Updated dependencies to only use `util-stream`
  - Updated runtime config to use `util-stream`
  - `yarn ts-mocha test/flexibleChecksums.spec.ts`
- Using the [aws-sdk-js-tests repo](https://github.com/aws-samples/aws-sdk-js-tests), tested the [GetObject command](https://github.com/aws/aws-sdk-js-v3/blob/main/clients/client-s3/src/commands/GetObjectCommand.ts):
  - Configured a bucket and object to get, added S3 client, and set up client to run the command
  - Imported the local util-stream package from the aws-sdk-js-v3 directory
  - Modified the client's `config` object to use the `util-stream` implementations of `getAwsChunkedEncodingStream` and `sdk-stream-mixin`
  - Ran `yarn start:node` and `yarn start:web` to see S3 object returned properly

### Additional context
The `util-stream` package was not added to any clients or middleware. This will be done in subsequent commits.

* feat(util-stream): merge node and browser implementations

* chore(github): add codeowners for util-stream

* fix(util-stream): fix file names for node

The initial merging of the two packages resulted in a
mistake where the node and browser implementations of
sdk-stream-mixins did not have the same file names. This
caused both implementations to be loaded by the browser,
which would throw an error because the node implementation
uses the 'stream' package.

* fix(util-stream): update jest config to test browser implementation

* fix(util-stream): fix file names for browser/react-native

Fixes a mistake from initial merging of implementations where the
output files for browser and react-native were named incorrectly in
package.json.",141,70,1,0

This commit adds support for the `aws.rest-xml` protocol, building
on top of the `HttpBindingProtocolGenerator` for document and
payload serde.

Implementations of the `DocumentMember[Deser|Ser]Visitor` and the
`DocumentShape[Deser|Ser]Visitor` have been created that handle
Smithy's XML traits and their influence on protocol serde.

A minor update has been made to the `XmlNode` to allow for nodes to
be renamed, as the same structure may change XML node names when it
is bound to different locations.",59,33,0,0

* feat(middleware-signing): support SigV4 for non AWS services

There is no regionInfo to determine signingService. The signingName
will instead directly come from input. And region will be used as
signingRegion.

* feat(codegen): support SigV4 for non AWS services

Write `signingName` from the SigV4 trait for non AWS service.
`region` is used for the signingRegion.
A separate SigV4Auth is used for SigV4 logic for non AWS services.

* fix(codegen): use Region plugin explicitly for AWS service

The models for the protocol tests don't seem to have the SigV4 trait,
so can't rely solely on it for using the Region plugin. e.g,
https://github.com/awslabs/smithy/blob/main/smithy-aws-protocol-tests/model/restJson1/main.smithy#L11-L13

* Add support for the aws.ec2 protocol

This commit adds support for the `aws.ec2` protocol, building on top
of the `HttpRpcProtocolGenerator`, `Xml[Member|Shape]DeserVisitor`,
and `Query[Member|Shape]SerVisitor` for document serde.

The `QueryShapeSerVisitor` has been opened up for re-use by the new
`Ec2ShapeSerVisitor` because `aws.ec2` is a specific version of the
`aws.query` protocol. Hooks have been made available to influence
the specific behavior that is updated.

This also fixes a critical bug with query list and map serialization
that would have resulted in runtime failues on serilaizing the member
target shape's contents.

Now this package can fully serialize & deserailize eventstream with web

to internal ReadableStream of binaries. In ReactNative, it converts from
user-side iterables of input structure to internal iterables of binaries.
The same applies to the other converting direction.

* chore: serialize rest json error code header (#2166)

* chore: short-circuit ssdk-incompatible integrations (#2167)

* chore: disable idempotency autofill import when not generating a client (#2181)

* Support generating non-AWS client (#2222)

* feat(config-resolver): make region optional for non-AWS client

* feat(codegen): skip integrations that are not relevant for non-AWS services

This is an initial version to get a working version of generated code
that compiles without manual edits in smithy-typescript-ssdk-demo. I
expect to make updates to this logic.

* chore(codegen): address code comments

The minor ones from https://github.com/adamthom-amzn/aws-sdk-js-v3/pull/1

* fix(codegen): use SigV4Trait check instead of ServiceTrait

AddAwsRuntimeConfigTest is checking for some behaviors from
AddAwsAuthPlugin too, which was failing with missing aws.auth#sigv4
trait after my change. Added the trait for now to the test, but unit
tests will need to be added/refactored for all these changes.

* chore(codegen): move isAwsService check to utils class

* chore(codegen): code style formatting

* chore(codegen): check SigV4 trait for including region

* chore(codegen,config-resolver): refactor how endpoint is resolved for non-AWS client (#2287)

* chore(config-resolver): refactor EndpointsConfig for non AWS services

This reverts an earlier change to EndpointsConfig.ts and instead
provides the new functionality in separate
CustomEndpointsConfig.ts. This will be used as a separate plugin for
endpoint resolution in non AWS clients.

* feat(codegen): Use separate CustomEndpointsConfig for non-AWS clients

This depends on newly added CustomEndpointsConfig in
@aws-sdk/config-resolver package.

* test(config-resolver): add test for CustomEndpointsConfig (#2305)

* fix: remove .npmignore's /src/ (for sourcemaps)

Crrently, SDKV3 publishes sourcemaps to npm but doesn't publish source
files that those sourcemaps point to. This missing source files breaks
debugging use-cases, especially for VSCode users because the VSCode
debugger relies on source files for setting breakpoints in the debugger,
for debugger call stacks, for ""step into"" original source, and any other
debugger use-cases. Even outside of debugging use-cases, it's helpful
for developers consuming transpiled libraries to have original source so
they can better understand what the library is doing. Finally, some tools
will show warnings when sourcemaps are present but source files are
missing, and this commit will fix these warnings.

* feat(credential-providers): collect credential providers in public facing package

* feat(credential-providers): support temporary credentials provider

Equivalent to ChainableTemporaryCredentials class in v2 SDK. The provider
is not re-exported from standalone package or used in the credential-
provider-ini because the roleAssumers function interface in other
packages does not suite the usecase of this provider. In roleAssumer
interface, the master credential is required. It's not true for
fromTemporaryCredentials, where master credentials can be skipped,
in which case the default credential will be used.

* docs: remove inline import to improve docs

* docs(credentail-providers): wrap other providers and add README

* docs(credential-provider): mark other provider as internal

* docs(upgrading): update the upgrading guide

* docs: use clientConfig to override all creds providers client config

1. Unflattened shapes that could return multiple entries in their
collection but only return one would result in an error at runtime
trying to iterate over an object like it was an Array.
2. Unflattened shapes that were not set in the provided output would
result in an error at runtime when trying to validate the entry element
exists without validating that its parent element existed.

This update also bumps the version of smithy-aws-traits to latest.",74,33,0,0
