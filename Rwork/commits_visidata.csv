- first push causes reload (self.rows is initially the UNLOADED sentinel)
- reload is usually async
- reload assigns a new object to .rows
- if you assign .rows after push, the reload thread may come by after and re-set it
- and maybe other members are reset by reload too
- so don't assign any members after push
- if you want it reloaded every push, call .reload() before the push

* [tests] Add failing tests demonstrating a tricky bug in namedlist

SequenceSheet rows can not have columns named ""length"" or ""_fields"" or
""__name__"" due to conflicts with existing attributes on the namedlist
implementation.  This affects formats like csv and tsv but not jsonl,
since the latter does not use SequenceSheet.

The ""length"" bug was reported in #344 and fixed back in Sept 2019, but
since then the bug was apparently re-introduced.  I did not bisect to
find the re-introduction.

* [utils] Fix namedlist bug with column named ""length""

Columns become attributes on the namedlist instance and a ""length""
column overwrote the namedlist.length() method.  This then broke
namedlist.__init__() which calls .length().  Remove .length() and use
the len() builtin instead directly on namedlist._fields.

This re-fixes issue #344 for all SequenceSheets (tsv, csv, xls(x),
fixed_width) and tests/column-name-length.vd now passes.

The more general issue of column names conflicting with the namedlist
implementation remains, and I'll try to address it in the next commit.

* [utils] Resolve namedlist implementation attrs over column name attrs

Removes explicitly created @propertys for each column.  Instead, column
name attributes will go through the class' __getattr__ and __setattr__
since they don't otherwise exist directly on the instance or class.
These special methods are only called if the attribute doesn't exist, so
implementation-required attributes like _fields and __name__ cannot be
used as column name attributes.  This prevents crashes of vd when such
column names exist in, for example, a csv file.  Columns can still bear
those internal names, however, and be looked up by index on the
namedlist.

The removed chunk of code appears to be from the original namedlist()
implementation introduced 2½ years ago in ""Restructure commandlog to
remove movements"" (8fb9e6a5).  About a year ago, the __get/setattr__
methods were added in ""[vgit] many fixes in status and branches sheets""
(8fc69a61).  I'm not sure why both ways of handling column name
attributes were used, but I believe only one is necessary.

An alternate solution could be to not use namedlist for user-provided
data and remove its use in SequenceSheet.  It could still be used for
hardcoded, vd-provided sheets.  This seemed liked a bigger change to the
internals to me, so I didn't do it, but it is perhaps less fraught with
peril in the long run.

All tests/column-name-*.vd files now pass.  No new test files fail
on this commit compared to before: 15 failures remain.",24,42,0,0

This was a subtle and terrible bug.

BaseSheet.__copy__ calls ret.__dict__.update(self.__dict__), so all
attributes are copied over; and they will be references (since it is a
shallow copy).  This is avoided for attributes created with
Extensible.init(copy=False), since they are re-created with the init
function after this update in the copy, and so they are set to fresh
values.  All other attributes, including those created by
@Extensible.lazy_property, won't be re-set.

There are some other lazy_property attributes that would be affected by
this, like the sheet-specific optionsSheet, and _deferredAdds/Mods/Dels.
But the lazy_property with the most obvious consequences, was
cmdlog_sheet, the cmdlog for this sheet only.  All copied sheets had the
same cmdlog_sheet as the sheet they were copied from, even though they
should have their own.  So commands for all dup'ed sheets would
erroneously share the cmdlog, and undo (which uses this cmdlog_sheet to
find the last modification to undo) would appear to be a more global
undo, as an undo on any of these copied sheets would undo the last
modification that happened to any of them.

This change makes lazy_property create its persisted attributes using .init(copy=False), so they won't be copied.
There is no way to make a @lazy_property share its result across copied sheets; this would have to be done manually.",92,76,1,1

- the last setting for a given option is also the cli-given global setting,

  setting already.

- --help opens the manpage

This allows both:

Limitations:

- there is no way to make an option apply only to the immediately following source
- nor a way to unset an option after setting it

Everything around CLI options needs to be tested thoroughly.

Undos, and there are not any cmdlog.rows for it to pull from in the
pre-command times.

This case is usually handled by if not vd.sheet, except when you replay,
a .vd (CommandLog) is loaded in the pre-command times, when the main
CommandLog is still not ready to stage undos

unpredictable undos, but this should be addressed in the future.",17,47,0,1

visidatarc, but we don't load args into options until after visidatarc.

- vd.replay() is no longer async; now it injects commands into vd._nextCommands, which run after curses idle timeout, instead of spawning a thread to execute commands.

- vd.replay_sync() still replays all commands as before (--batch mode should be unaffected).

- much simpler architecturally, but loses the ability to pause/resume, and show 1/N progress (now just shows number of queued commands remaining).
  - Ctrl+N is now no-op for similar functionality to replay-advance
    - replay-advance command itself is removed
  - removed options.replay_movement and its functionality

  - options.replay_wait (-w on CLI) now works by setting the curses timeout, which will affect the display update frequency for all async commands.  previously was hard-coded.  try -w 0.001 while loading a big file to see a very rapid update.

- replay in general should be more stable and possibly faster.",65,83,1,1

To avoid this issue:

- e to edit a field at the bottom of the window
- Ctrl+O to open in e.g. vim
- shrink window (so field is off-screen)

- input() can't redraw new text, raises an exception, edit is lost

There's no good way to resize the screen while in input mode.

So rather than lose the edit, it will be auto-applied after sysedit.

Both setValues and setValue call addUndo, and setValues calls setValue.
So multiple undofuncs are added for some commands, like delete-cell.
Calling these undofuncs as implemented and in the order they are added, causes some internal confusion leading to this warning message, but actually nothing is incorrect and the results are the same.
Ideally, commands would not add more undofuncs than necessary (it can waste memory), but that's trickier than this fix, which just calls undofuncs in reverse LIFO order, so that subsequent undofuncs undo previous themselves without concern.",25,60,0,1

The cmdlog was storing the integer row index as the rowname.
When saved, this index is converted to a string in the .vd file.
On replay, moveToReplayContext moves the row cursor to the given row.
It uses `if r.row` to detect if a row was specified.
When the row is `0` (int, not str), this check is false.
Redo replays the undone command, and since the row context hasn't been stringified to a .vd, it doesn't detect the given row if it is 0.
So redoing an undone command that was executed from the first row, will redo it in an improper context.

This fix sets the row/col context as strings, even when they are numeric indexes.",32,34,0,1

This was a subtle and terrible bug.

BaseSheet.__copy__ calls ret.__dict__.update(self.__dict__), so all
attributes are copied over; and they will be references (since it is a
shallow copy).  This is avoided for attributes created with
Extensible.init(copy=False), since they are re-created with the init
function after this update in the copy, and so they are set to fresh
values.  All other attributes, including those created by
@Extensible.lazy_property, won't be re-set.

There are some other lazy_property attributes that would be affected by
this, like the sheet-specific optionsSheet, and _deferredAdds/Mods/Dels.
But the lazy_property with the most obvious consequences, was
cmdlog_sheet, the cmdlog for this sheet only.  All copied sheets had the
same cmdlog_sheet as the sheet they were copied from, even though they
should have their own.  So commands for all dup'ed sheets would
erroneously share the cmdlog, and undo (which uses this cmdlog_sheet to
find the last modification to undo) would appear to be a more global
undo, as an undo on any of these copied sheets would undo the last
modification that happened to any of them.

This change makes lazy_property create its persisted attributes using .init(copy=False), so they won't be copied.
There is no way to make a @lazy_property share its result across copied sheets; this would have to be done manually.",92,76,1,1

Fixes #1362

According to the docs for csv.writer:

> If csvfile is a file object, it should be opened with newline=''
> https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#csv.writer

Additionally:

> If newline='' is not specified, newlines embedded inside quoted fields will
> not be interpreted correctly, and on platforms that use \r\n linendings on
> write an extra \r will be added. It should always be safe to specify
> newline='', since the csv module does its own (universal) newline handling.
> https://docs.python.org/3/library/csv.html#id3

This commit adds `newline=None` as a keyword argument for `open_text` in
`path.py`. It then uses this new keyword argument when opening a file
for writing in `loaders/csv.py`",32,66,0,0

* [describe-] collect aggr funcs that operate on list of values in OrderedDict

aggregator() converts a func, which operates on a list, into a _func,
which operates on a srccol and a list of rows.

The original functions were then added into Globals, but this caused problems for
a function like `sum()` which appears naturally in Python code.

I created an OrderedDict, and named it aggregators_vals as a place to
store them.

Other possible options:

* We could include the optional funcvals along with func(srccol) for
Aggregator. Describe Sheet could then grab the funcvals if it exists.

* Describe Sheet could pass the srccol and list of rows, instead of
vals. This is not ideal because it means for each aggregator, we call
getValues once-more. This would cause a performance degradation.

* Add them to vd.aggregators, possibly with the suffix ""_vals"", and
create an Aggregator out of them as well. Have Describe Sheet pull
aggrname_vals.

* Similarly use the vd.aggregator_vals, but have a less terrible name.

Optional: Do we want to do the work of porting quantiles and percentiles to be useable by Describe Sheet? Currently, an aggregator that does not go through aggregator() is not useable by Describe Sheet.

* private functions should start with _",79,82,1,1

The rowdef on joined sheets was a list of references to the rows on the source sheets.
Columns on joined sheets got the row ref by numeric index.

Columns on 'extend' joined sheets, however, depended on rowsBySheetKey, a dict saved on the joined sheet.
With multiple extend joins, the rowsBySheetKey on intermediate sheets was unavailable to columns on the final sheet.

Now a ref to rowsBySheetKey is stored on the columns themselves, and
rowdef for joined sheets is now a dict of row references, by sheet object.

This fixes the issue, and is more robust in general.

1) Use pd.pivot_table which will be more memory-efficient

2) Change PandasFreqTable.select to directly interact with

The rowdef on joined sheets was a list of references to the rows on the source sheets.
Columns on joined sheets got the row ref by numeric index.

Columns on 'extend' joined sheets, however, depended on rowsBySheetKey, a dict saved on the joined sheet.
With multiple extend joins, the rowsBySheetKey on intermediate sheets was unavailable to columns on the final sheet.

Now a ref to rowsBySheetKey is stored on the columns themselves, and
rowdef for joined sheets is now a dict of row references, by sheet object.

This fixes the issue, and is more robust in general.

vd.mainloop() calls curses.timeout(-1) in order to idle indefinitely
within getkeystroke(), when nothing else is happening (no other threads
are active).

Since 0d83d3a23a5f11b6b1561a8b5c9210ca4cb38f82, getkeystroke() also
calls curses.timeout in order to drain pending keystrokes into its
own buffer.  After draining, it resets the timeout to vd.curses_timeout,
which cancels the manipulation from vd.mainloop().

This fix makes vd.mainloop set vd.curses_timeout, so that getkeystroke()
will restore the timeout to -1 when fully idle.

vd.mainloop() stores a copy of vd.curses_timeout on entry, so this means
that nothing can effectively change vd.curses_timeout while vd is
running.  (Not that anything should need to change it anyway, but just
as a note.)",45,71,1,1

An initial hacky implementation for using value_counts()
to generate frequency table for pandas, which is vectorized
and hence significantly faster than the approach in
PivotTable. Added support for [Enter] > sourcerows.
Toggling/selection support is still broken here because
id(row) will not work with pandas.

Also tried to do some small cleanup with dtype
handling in PandasSheet.

This commit includes a lot of experimental and debugging
code which can be removed.
