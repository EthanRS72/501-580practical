We are getting more and more requests to add options and the current code which
updates the DOM for the options page using vanilla JS has reached its breaking
point.

I've tried various frameworks but finally settled on Preact. Svelte looked
promising but has a really hard time with types for event handlers. We'd like
not to regress type safety for this. Also, the only suitable component mounting
framework I could find for it was Storybook which wanted us to install too many
other dependencies.

I looked into Lit too but Web Components are still really tricky with regards to
accessibility and extracting styles.

Preact is very lightweight (more than SolidJS etc.) so we can probably use it in
the content script eventually without too much trouble. It's also a familiar
API for anyone wanting to contribute.

I probably didn't need to introduce Tailwind--the styles for the options page
are not too bad--but I misunderstood how React Cosmos was loading styles and
thought it was necessary to add some sort of CSS-in-JS solution. I tried to use
Vanilla Extract and various others approaches but none of them would let me both
colocate the styles with the component code and extract a single stylesheet at
the end.

All this is not only groundwork for making the options page easier to maintain
and extend but also we ultimately want to apply a similar approach to the popup.
This should allow us to drop all the half-baked test files we currently use and
finally make the popup a bit more interactive (e.g. clickable links etc.).

Furthermore, the popup styles are a mess so using something like Tailwind will
eventually allow us to maintain those styles without breaking things.

What's more, as part of doing this we had to introduce an approach for toggling
the locale. Once we use this approach everywhere we will finally be able to
allow the user to set the language used by 10ten's interface to something
different to their browser language.",2,81,1

That's not necessary a problem except that if our check to see if our
current text position has changed returns false positives we'll end up
doing a new search on the default dictionary meaning the result will
reset to the word dictionary each time we release the Shift key making
it basically impossible to cycle through dictionaries with the Shift
key.",10,53,1

Fixes #978.

Specifically when looking up words like バカ売れ and ガタガタ we would
prioritize the hiragana version, sometimes even hiding the katakana
version altogether.

This is because, when doing a search on the IDB database, we first
normalize the text to hiragana.

Now, the IDB database itself is able to look up kana variants but I
believe we were doing the hiragana conversion separately to that so we
can do deinflection using normalized hiragana.

This patch moves the normalization to the point where we do deinflection
so that we preserve the source kana form and jpdict-idb can use that to
more accurately set the match labels on the different headwords.

As a result, cases like サボった now correctly show サボる as the match
while cases that use katakana in the deinflected part should still work.",5,67,1

It doesn't add any value but just makes it harder to separate out the
different functionality.

If we ever decide to switch to an event page model (and that seems
unlikely--we should just jump straight to Service Workers), then we'll
need to move these event registrations to the top-level anyway.

More likely, if we try to separate out this logic into different modules
having it all wrapped in one class will just complicate things.

By splitting this out, it also makes it easier to do an initial callback
to db state listeners which this patch also does.",12,33,0

On slow connection, our call to resizeObserver.observe() would sometimes
trigger a layout flush, terminating Firefox's paint suppression and
causing visible flicker.

This patch reworks the safe area provider so that we only set it up on
demand which should mean we never start observing while the page is
still loading and furthermore prevents us from polluting the DOM with
our safe-area-provider element on pages where the user does not look up
anything.",8,70,1

This fixes #73.

This also updates the types for masu stems so that we don't try to
further deinflect the result of a masu stem conjugation (since the
result should already be in the plain form).

This was necessary because otherwise we would deinflect 食べて into
食べてる (treating 食べて as a masu stem) and then proceed to de-inflect
that again using the continuous form into 食べる so the reason presented
for many て forms erroneously included the continuous form as a possible
conjugation reason.",13,37,0

fine-tune based on usage on iOS 15

chore: Simplify safe area getters

chore: Drop unused puck dimensions

chore: Make the safe area insets a parameter passed into the popup positioning method

chore: Simplify puck lifetime management (and fix theme toggling too)

chore: Use the safe area insets to determine which vertical height to use

chore: Don't constraint the width/height of the popup when it is manually positioned

chore: Factor out clearTooltips parameter

chore: Simplify popup manual positioning modes

These modes are a niche feature (disabled by default) and should not
try to avoid the puck or be constrained. They are engaged (using
keyboard shortcuts) when the user specifically wants to override the
auto positioning so they should be as simple and predictable as
possible.

(The approach before this patch wasn't working for me either -- it would
often position the window so that it was overflowing the right edge and
couldn't be read.)

chore: Factor out common cursor clearance code

chore: Drop alignment with top of moon

I can't see that it makes a significant difference (it's only 5px
anyway). After the popup shows, it's possible (and common) to move the
moon up and down and the popup position won't change so any alignment
will be lost.

On the other hand, passing this parameter around complicates the logic
and interfaces quite a bit so I think it's best to drop it unless we're
sure it's necessary.
