* Rawframe edit:
 * - TESTED ON WLED VS.0.10.1 - WHERE ONLY PRESET 16 SAVES SEGMENTS - some macros may not be needed if this changes.
 * - Code has been modified as my usage changed, as such it has poor use of functions vs if thens, but feel free to change it for me :)
 * 
 * Edited to SWITCH between two lighting scenes/modes : STANDBY and HIGHLIGHT
 * 
 * Usage:
 *  - Standby is the default mode and Highlight is activated when the PIR detects activity.
 *  - PIR delay now set to same value as Nightlight feature on boot but otherwise controlled as normal.
 *  - Standby and Highlight brightness can be set on the fly (default values set on boot via macros calling presets).
 *  - Macros are used to set Standby and Highlight states (macros can load saved presets etc).
 * 
 *    - Macro short button press   =  Highlight state default (used on boot only and sets default brightness).
 *    - Macro double button press  =  Standby state default   (used on boot only and sets default brightness).
 *    - Macro long button press    =  Highlight state         (after boot).
 *    - Macro 16                   =  Standby state           (after boot).
 *
 *    ! It is advised not to set 'Apply preset at boot' or a boot macro (that activates a preset) as we will call our own macros on boot.
 * 
 *  - When the strip is off before PIR activates the strip will return to off for Standby mode, and vice versa.
 *  - When the strip is turned off while in Highlight mode, it will return to standby mode. (This behaviour could be changed easily if for some reason you wanted the lights to go out when the pir is activated).
 *  - Macros can be chained so you could do almost anything, such as have standby mode also turn on the nightlight function with a new time delay.
 * 
 * Segment Notes:
 * - It's easier to save the segment selections in preset than apply via macro while we a limited to preset 16. (Ie, instead of selecting sections at the point of activating standby/highlight modes). 
 * - Because only preset 16 saves segments, for now we are having to use additional macros to control segments where they are involved. Macros can be chained so this works but it would be better if macros also accepted json-api commands. (Testing http api segment behaviour of SS with SB left me a little confused).
 * 
 * Future:
 *  - Maybe a second timer/timetable that turns on/off standby mode also after set inactivity period / date & times. For now this can be achieved others ways so may not be worth eating more processing power.",212,45,0,0

* Alexa RGBW Support

When adding an RGBW device to Alexa and then selecting a white color tone, Alexa will send CT values to the device. Having a warm white or cold white strip should use 100% of that strip and then add the RGB colors to get either a warmer color or a colder one.

* 40 keys IR Remote 

Added IR remote with 40 keys to use with RGBW stripes.

* ESU8285 flash size corrected

* Use different IR remotes in the settings

To turn off IR remote use ""0"" in the settings, use 1 to 4 for different IR remote types.

* Use 5CH solid RGB stripes

adapt the logic to use CW and WW for different CT-values

* change from Opt-Out to Opt-In for solid (analoge) RGB stripes

Changed code from #define WLED_DISABLE_ANALOG_LEDS to #define WLED_USE_ANALOG_LEDS

* DEFINES for different devices added

* order of PINs alligned to hardware

* Update readme.md

* correct initialization of variable rgb[]

* SunRise Effect

NightLight used to brighten the light combined with fading from the actual (primary) color to the secondary color

* Fixed headline

RLYPIN definition dependant on WLED_USE_ANALOG_LEDS

Corrected list-item indents (readme.md)

updated to match upstream master (briLast in wled00.ino)

in default intensity (128) everything looks the same, decreasing the intensity will desaturate the color towards WHITE

* PIO changes

* adjusted linker scripts, debug settings etc.

* Override script updated accordingly

* ldscriipt for 1m0 adjusted

* backup files deleted

* updated to use espressif8266@2.3.3

...instead of espressif8266@2.3.2  (both on arduino 2.6.3)

* added more options to the PIO-override.ini

* analog, too

* build only 5 envs with Travis.CI

* should be include not exclude

* YAML correction

* next YAML

* UNDO

* some effects behave wrong with strips longer then 256 LEDs

This is particular true for the effects ""Phased"" and ""Phased Noise"" as well as for ""Chase Rainbow"".

The reason is that in this cases 256 is divided by SEGLEN and used in the formula, but with SEGLEN greater than 256 the integer result will always be ZERO.",221,47,0,0

* Prevent UI from sliding when using sliders (#1400)

An iro.js version bump in commit 98e4ac6 changed names for the slider &
colorwheel classes which made the filter in function lock() fail.

Also it seems that not all elements of the Iro sliders & colorwheel have
appropriate classes set. Just changing the names still sometimes failed
when the user accidentally grabbed a part of the slider / colorwheel
that has no class name set.

To mitigate this, lock() now checks the events classlist for classes
starting with ""Iro"" as well as it's parents classlist if no ""Iro"" classes
were found

* Improved pin manager, ethernet config

* Ethernet is configured prior even to LED pins
* Pin Manager allocation / deallocation functions
   now take an ""ownership"" tag parameter, helping
   avoid accidentally free'ing pins that were allocated
   by other code
* Pin Manager now has ability to allocate multiple
  pins at once; Simplifies error handling

* Fix operator precedence error

Bitwise AND has lower precedence than the
relational ""greater than"" operator.

* PinManager update for some user modules

* don't build everything...

* Final step to reduce RAM overhead

* update comment

* remove macros

* Remove leftover allocated

* Init ethernet after settings saved

* Testing new wrapper functions to read Usermod config

* Usermod Settings polishing
- remove getBoolFromJsonKey() (no longer needed), fix getValueFromJsonKey(element, destination, defaultvalue)
- Update Usermod Settings html ""number"" field to use step=""any"", and make wider to make maximum values fully visible
  - step=""any"" allows viewing/submitting full 7/8-digit float values, and the arrow buttons step by 1 now, instead of .00001 (which wasn't good for integers or floats)
  - html wasn't generated/compressed yet

* Update usermod_v2_example.h with more complete example and documentation for Usermod Settings
- readFromConfig() has three options for how to load values from the config JSON, we need to pick one

* Update/rename usermode_rotary_brightness_color, to be used as an example of more robust parsing Usermod Settings values

* Update Usermod example, rename getValueFromJsonKey() to getJsonValue()
- chose single readFromConfig() pattern
- demonstrating 3-argument getJsonValue()
- remove leftover printf in getJsonValue()

I added a Usermod interface for key settings.  I used a PinArray for the SDA/SCL pins, but you can't name these individually.

I have also made a display to show the temperature/humidity values in the web interface's Info screen.

I had to change the definition of those items in order to allow these new functions to work.  I have not noticed any negative side effects to this change.

At the moment, I've not figured out how to make Celsius/Farenheit toggleable due to the way the #define setup works.

Finally, I have added a routine to publish MQTT Discovery Topics for Home Assistant (toggleable in the Usermod screen).

this is a band-aid fix for random crashes when switching between presets with multiple segments - crossfade disabled.

!! adding type initializers fixed it for me on -S3, however I still see (less frequent) crashes on esp32, due to heap corruption.

It took me hours to get a meaningful stackdump:

assert failed: heap_caps_free heap_caps.c:360 (heap != NULL && ""free() target pointer is outside heap areas"")

Adds wifi scanning to the JSON api at `/json/networks`. The initial
request will trigger a scan, subsequent requests will scan or return the

Add a `Scan` button next to the client ssid input, on click, scan for
networks, and change the input to a select with the found ssids.

Fixes: #1964

* Added option to go back to manual SSID input

I2S microphones were not working any more in with the newest framework - only delivers silence.
Ther reason is stupid bug in espressif I2S ""compatibility"" driver: RIGHT and LEFT channel are swapped, so when only asking for LEFT, we get silence from RIGHT.

Workaround: simply change LEFT to RIGHT, until the problem is fixed in ESP-IDF --> Fix tested on ""classic ESP32"", but still need to check behavior on -S3.
Code compiles also on -S3, -S2, and -C3.

- a few changes to use new APIs (MCLK, rouing and sample resolution)
- a few additional debug messages

The code was sending illegal hostname strings to WiFi.hostname() (which is then submitted to DHCP and often times to DNS.)  A valid hostname contains only alphanumeric characters and hyphens (though it can't start with a hypen.)  This change simply alters the value passed to wifi.hostname() by replacing all non alphanum chars with hyphens while ensuring the first char is never a hyphen.  If the resulting hostname is empty, it uses the escapedMac value (which I'm assuming is initialized by the time this code executes.)
