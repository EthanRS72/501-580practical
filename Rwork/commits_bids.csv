Text is using both 'file name' and 'filename' pretty much to the equal amount
ATM (see git grep outputs below).  Code uses 'filename', and wikipedia has
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filename and prefers to use 'filename' in it. So
I decided to harmonize  into  'filename'.

		 9	src/02-common-principles.md:It is evident from the file name alone that the file contains resting state
		10	src/02-common-principles.md:Entities within a file name MUST be unique.
		11	src/02-common-principles.md:For example, the following file name is not valid because it uses the `acq`

		30	src/schema/README.md:Given that all entities appear in filenames, they should all be strings and the `type` field should always be `string`.
		31	src/schema/README.md:For example, `run` should have an index, so a valid key-value pair in a filename would be `run-01`.

		36	src/schema/README.md:Each dictionary corresponds to a group of suffixes that have the same rules regarding filenames.
		37	src/schema/README.md:**NOTE**: The order in which entities appear in these dictionaries does not reflect how they should appear in filenames.
		38	src/schema/README.md:This file contains a list of entities in the order in which they must appear in filenames.

Addresses the use case of DWI sequencies that need to be split in several
runs because, e.g., the scanner would exceed temperature specifications
due to fast gradient-switching.

This PR also refactors the text of DWIs to better accomodate the addition
and make DWIs more consistent with the rest of the file.

The approach to solve this is similar to that of #622 for fieldmaps.

* Update table errors

* correction for table issues 'common metadata for PCASL/PASL'

* correction latin phrases

* Corrections tables

* correction tables Cases

* added link pepolar

* deleted 'don't discriminate between types of labeling

based on comment Thijs Van Osch

* Moved MagneticFieldStrenght asl requirement to common

* removed scaling factor info based on comment gllmflndn

Removed:
all ancillary scaling factors should be taken into account in the conversion to BIDS, which is why BIDS does not provide a separate scaling factor field other than the NIfTI header.

* added MRAcquisitionType

added in the common - sequence specifics table
Reason: for ASL, defining 2D and 3D is required. This used to be added in the PulseSequenceType field, but this should stay a free text field. Therefore, the MRAcquisitionType field is added (based on DicomTag).

* removed PulseSequenceType from the ASL part

The 2D/3D information needed for ASL, is now moved to the new MRAcquisitionType field.

* added required common fields sentence

Some Common fields are required for ASL. To stress this out, we added a sentence for the *_as.json and the *_m0scan.json.

* adaptation requirements for m0scan.json

* adapted requirement level common fields for m0scan

* update sentence required common fields for asl.json

* Update common field EchoTime

* Removed EchoTime from ASL-table

* update FlipAngle in common RF and Contrasts

* remove FlipAngle from ASL fields

* update Dependency table ASL for MRAcquisitionType

* update SliceTiming in common fields

* remove SliceTiming from ASL tables

* added (FA) for FlipAngle

* update common RF and Contrast for table check

* LabelingPulseDuration and LabelingPulseInterval in ms instead of s

* required common metadatafields update

RepetitionTime or VolumeTiming to RepetitionTimePreparation

* update flipangle for timeseries versus file collections

* update echotime for timeseries

* update timing table (fence)

* update definition BackgroundSuppressionPulseTime

* removed common metadata fields from asl table

MagneticFieldStrenght, EchoTime, SliceTiming, VolumeTiming, RepetitionTime, FlipAngle, PulseSequenceType

* update scaling of asl and m0 files

- update scaling description for nifti files
- created separate scaling section (to highlight this important quantification factor), and M0 section
- moved scaling section and M0 section after aslcontext section

* update broken link in EchoTime (Timing Parameters)

* update broken link (2) EchoTime

* Update broken links FlipAngle

* LabelingType changed to ArterialSpinLabelingType

- changed in fields
- Changed in dependency table
- Dependency table: additionally removed repetitiontime/volumetiming parts

* Update dependency table based on new M0Type and M0Estimate fields

* Update new M0 field strategy

M0 field becomes M0Type, with addition field M0Estimate.
Also corrected IntendedFor description in m0 specific fields

* TEMPORARY: disable 'strict' docs build

this allows the build to proceed despite broken links

* changed fail_on_warning to true 

Intermediate solution to get BEP005 build untill the missing link is available

* [SCHEMA] Insist .nii.gz be as reproducible as possible

By removing extraneous metadata, pipelines generating BIDS datasets can avoid making unnecessary changes.

We are motivated to this since we are working on combining BIDS with datalad in our workflows, and if a pipeline regenerates hundreds of images with no change, then we rapidly bloat our storage costs and obscures real changes in `git log`. datalad (thanks to git-annex) avoids the bandwidth/storage costs of downstream users, since most of our users download once only, or are always downloading fresh HEAD copies to processing nodes, but our internal storage costs are a big factor for us.

This can be implemented with `gzip -n` in most environments, or equally by running https://salsa.debian.org/reproducible-builds/strip-nondeterminism over a BIDS dataset before publishing.

I don't know where the type key came from. 
I also tried to remove the reference to a space table in the introduction that has moved (is it in the appendix?)

(I'll post this an issue)
So currently we have. _dseg.tsv suffix for color lookup tables. A label-<label> key value pair for specifying the label in _probseg.nii.gz files. And files with multiple mask (i.e. atlases having a _dseg.nii.gz) extension. And and atlas-<label> key value pair that appears in fmri..

1. is it ok for _dseg.nii.gz and _dseg.tsc to have the same suffix? or are suffixes supposed to associate with a specific file type.
2. technically the _dparc.dlabel.nii could be _dseg.dlabel.nii because they have similar concepts (just cifti vs nifti).

* ENH: introduce versioning of the schema itself

Note -- it is not a version of the content of the schema, it is
a version over organization of the schema (e.g. we could add some
schema to describe how schema is organized).

The 'desire' for having a version over the BIDS schema's version
is somewhat described in README.md in added section.  Just to facilitate
tools to know what versions of bids schema they can read without explicitly
whitelisting BIDS versions themselves.

* Adding versioning for after 1.0.0

I thought we had it but managed to screw it up during rebase. Thanks @sappelhoff

* Draft formats file.

* Limit time zones to between 3 and 4 characters.

* Add stimuli_relative format.

* Don't allow absolute paths or problematic start folders.

* Use URI regex.

From https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3986#appendix-B.

* Fix(?) BIDS URI regex.

* Update formats.yaml

* Don't allow just zeros in index regex.

* pattern --> format.

* Document the rules for the different formats.

* Remove fancy n/a handling.

I was so proud of it too :sob:

* Move formats file into rules folder.

* Actually, the individual formats are really objects.

* Add patterns for rrid and time.

* Be more specific with RRIDs.

* Remove anchors around patterns and add quotes.

* Replace double-quotes with single-quotes.

* Draft a test for formats.

* Add names for tests. They probably won't ever be used.

* Add more valid pattern tests.

* Fix mistake in date/datetime patterns.

* Make time part of datetimes more restrictive.

* Make datetimes more robust.

* Add more bad-pattern checks.

* Apply suggestions from code review

* Test the new pattern changes.

* Apply suggestions from code review

Thanks for the suggestions @yarikoptic. They're great!

* Reorder formats alphabetically within each section.

* Run black on test and improve check.

* Comment out failing pattern, but add a note about it.

This PR addresses the problem @mattcieslak spotted at in #239.

This enhancement (WIP) basically allows for researchers to encode
the protocol's intent regarding fieldmaps.

As @satra introduced in #239 (comment),
BIDS ""*could encode intent and automation. Whether it should is a community decision.""

This PR proposes a solution to encoding the intent. It doesn't modify
anything to allow also encoding automation.

The PR attempts to be backwards compatible, and is based off of #651,
where the text about fieldmaps is being revised.

I'm submitting this draft PR to open discussions and looking forward to
feedback.

Resolves: #239.
Depends: #651.

* [FIX] Revise template-generated coordinate systems

This PR supersedes #213, and should be rebased with master after #306 is
merged.

W.r.t. master it only adds the table of _Nonstandard template
identifiers_

W.r.t. `common-derivatives`, the changes are:

  - [x] Removed the distinction between surface templates and volumetric
        templates. After all, to properly apply a surface template one
        should first spatially normalize to a particular volumetric
        template. Although it is possible to create mixed templates
        (e.g. using ``MNI152Lin`` to generate a mapping for volumetric
        coordinates and then, say, ``fsLR`` for the surface after some
        surface mapping process), this option should be discouraged.
        Anyways, this discussion does not affect how the names of BIDS
        entities should be specified, since one can always describe how
        the template coordinates are generated with the information
        described in this PR.
  - [x] Removed ``MNI152NLin6AsymConte69`` because it does not define
        any new coordinate system (see
        https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/207#discussion_r278911304),
  - [x] Removed ``FS305`` as it is now covered by ``fsaverage``.
  - [x] Reorganized subsections in ""standard"" vs ""nonstandard"" spaces.

* fix: added the concept of ``scanner`` as an Image-based coordinate system

- [x] Describes more clearly the situation when files do not have
``space-`` definition.
- [x] Remove the ``ReferenceIndex`` as an index does not generate a
coordinate system (the concept here is mixed up with that of  image
registration, which is just a process).",39,14,0

* Added _task label to MR spec text

Modified the text in MR markdown as well as added task to anat.yaml file under rules so it appears in the tables

* removed additional white space

* Update src/04-modality-specific-files/01-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data.md

I agree with Remi's reasoning here.

Co-authored-by: Remi Gau <remi_gau@hotmail.com>

* To fulfill requests in PR #1185

As discussed in the  [PR #1185](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/1185)  I added this recommended meta information for structural tasks as well. Note the descriptions differ slightly from the ones for task.

* Updated TaskName example

In order to make the TaskName example more general, I suggest to replace the reference to `""faces n-back""` with `""task x-x""`, sicne this is only meant to showcase what name formatting should look like.

* Update src/04-modality-specific-files/01-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data.md

* Apply suggestions from code review

* Reorganized sorting of entities 

As was pointed out by Remi with reference to [issue 1017](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues/1071) the entities should be sorted. I have now put task in front of acquisition in order in all of anat.

* Remove duplication of infor with appendix

Removed the sentence ""Task labels MUST be consistent across subjects and sessions."" under task since this is part of the definition in the appendices already.

* Update src/schema/objects/metadata.yaml

Co-authored-by: Chris Markiewicz <effigies@gmail.com>

* Added TaskMetaData

As requested [here](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/1185#discussion_r990039927), I am adding TaskMetadata into the anat.yaml.

* Update src/04-modality-specific-files/01-magnetic-resonance-imaging-data.md

* Fixing trailing white spaces

* Removed subheading 

Removed subheading ""RECOMMENDED metadata for tasks in anatomical imaging"" as suggested [here](https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/1185#discussion_r990036321)

Note: it is different from PyBIDS which ATM does not require leading
'.' for `extension` specification in the queries.

spec.  It might be arguable either spec should or should not include them.
I think it should since we already RECOMMEND things.  We of cause could
place recommendations into a separate subsection somewhere but then they
would not be linked to the specific topics and thus would not be attended
to. Hence I placed this one right at the section where it is pertinent",10,2,0

Due to --since-tag issue. See:
https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/pull/594#issuecomment-688709082
And investigation here:
https://gitter.im/github-changelog-generator/chat?at=5f57456cec534f584fedf00d
This param gets automatically set when using
--base, because the ""base"" file gets parsed for versions. In our case,
the latest version in ""base"" (pregh-changes.md) happens to be 1.1.1,
and then --since-tag is automatically set to 1.1.1 and that tag
cannot be found in the repository, because we never tagged such a
version in git.

Alternative options next to downgrading github-changelog-generator
are (i) to make a PR against github-changelog-generator and add
an option that allows explicitly setting --since-tag to None, or
(ii) tagging the first commit of the bids-specification repository
as 1.1.1, however the latter would be a weird hack.",50,23,0

#487 (and originally #439) is a `WIP ENH` to introduce standardized provenance
capture/expression for BIDS datasets.  This PR just follows the idea of #371
(small atomic ENHs), and is based on current state of the specification where
we have GeneratedBy to describe how a BIDS derivative dataset came to its
existence.

## Rationale

As I had  previously stated in many (face-to-face when it was still
possible ;)) conversations, in my view, any BIDS dataset is a derivative
dataset.  Even if it contains ""raw"" data, it is never given by gods, but is a
result of some process (let's call it pipeline for consistency) which produced
it out of some other data. That is why there is 1) `sourcedata/` to provide
placement for such original (as ""raw"" in terms of processing, but ""raw""er in
terms of its relation to actual data acquired by equipment), and 2) `code/` to
provide placement for scripts used to produce or ""tune"" the dataset.  Typically
""sourcedata"" is either a collection of DICOMs or a collection of data in some
other formats (e.g. nifti) which is then either converted or just renamed into
BIDS layout. When encountering a new BIDS dataset ATM it requires forensics
and/or data archaeology to discover how this BIDS dataset came about, to e.g.
possibly figure out the source of the buggy (meta)data it contains.

At the level of individual files, some tools already add ad-hoc fields
during conversion into side car .json files they produce,

<details>
<summary>e.g. dcm2niix adds ConversionSoftware and ConversionSoftwareVersion</summary>

```shell
(git-annex)lena:~/datalad/dbic/QA[master]git
$> git grep ConversionSoftware | head -n 2
sub-amit/ses-20180508/anat/sub-amit_ses-20180508_acq-MPRAGE_T1w.json:  ""ConversionSoftware"": ""dcm2niix"",
sub-amit/ses-20180508/anat/sub-amit_ses-20180508_acq-MPRAGE_T1w.json:  ""ConversionSoftwareVersion"": ""v1.0.20170923 (OpenJPEG build) GCC6.3.0"",

```
</details>

ATM I need to add such metadata to datasets produced by heudiconv to make
sure that in case of incremental conversions there is no switch in versions of
the software.",38,36,0

Closes #654

https://github.com/bids-standard/bids-specification/issues/654 provides more of
discussion with a number of people bringing up the  use cases which keep coming about.

As EchoTime is a recommended sidecar file metadata field for any file of 'mri' modality,
I decided that it would only be logical for at least existing use cases (T1w) and possibly
other cases (to not overspecify T1w) to simply allow for ""echo"" entity to be used if so
necessary to distignuish two files while they do remain of that weighting (e.g. T1w) given
the EchoTime values.",11,59,1

Following on from ea2bc965.
- Fix grammattical error in description of DWI JSON.
- Modify description of recommended NODDI model output.
- For ""fwDTI"" model, separate tensor coefficients and free water fraction data into two separate NIfTI images.
- For DTI model, include iterative weighted least squares as an option, and separate RESTORE (outlier rejection) as being a separate parameter rather than a method of fitting.
- For CSD model, offer two mechanisms for specifying the response function; also remove MRtrix 0.2 SH basis, and remove ""none"" from NonNegativityConstraint (as without a non-negativity constraint, it would not be CSD).
- Provide additional examples for DWI model outputs.
- Remove NODDI parameters from ""model-derived maps"", as these are re-classified as fundamental model output parameters.
- Remove DECFA from ""model-derived maps"", and instead define ""directionally-encoded colour maps"" as a different form of model-derived map, since any scalar map can be augmented with DEC.
- Add ""Count"" as a compulsory parameter for tractography output.
- For tractography output, provide three distinct dictionaries within the JSON: ""Constraints"" (ROIs and anatomical tissue constraints), ""Parameters"" (for parameters specific to the streamlines tractography algorithm), and ""Seeding"" (since determining streamline seeds is in fact independent of the particular tractography algorithm and parameters). Field ""TerminationCriterion"" was removed in this process as it is common for there to be more than one mechanism by which streamlines are terminated. Possibilities for streamline seeding have been more broadly generalised as part of this process.",22,6,0
