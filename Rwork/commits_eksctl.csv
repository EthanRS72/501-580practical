This has brought the total runtime of Windows integration tests down to ~55 minutes from ~2 hours and 30 minutes.

* Consistent desctiption across flags using StringToString

Changes to ensure there is a consistent description across flags using
StringToString. Change involved adding k1=v1,k2=v2 in the description
and also noting it is a list of KV pairs in all ocurrence of use.

Issue #1616

* String to string wrapper for description prefix

Flag Wrapper change to allow for a static description prefix across
future uses of the stringToString flag.

Fixes #1616

* StringToString description updates

StringToString flag common description comes after the flag specific
description. This change also removes examples in specific descriptions.

Fixes #1616

* StringToString tag description backticks

Backticks in flag specific description removed.

Fixes #1616

one need CloudFormation stack ID (not just stack name).",117,9,0

* Handle pod eviction errors correctly

Currently any eviction error causes the draining of a node to stop and a new
node to start draining.  Eviction errors are common, expected occurences
especially when PDBs are used in the cluster.
By having any error abort the draining of a node we slow down the entire node
draining process as many of the pods further in the list could happily be
drained.

This change separates recoverable and irrecoverable eviction errors and retries
only the recoverable.  Unrecoverable errors fail the entire command.

An important aspect of this is that the `evictPods` function becomes blocking
until a node is drained or the process times out.  This is required as the
current implementation begins draining another node on the first eviction
error.  We would rather keep trying and eventually time out than make a bad
situation worse by draining a new node.

This change implements default values for `kube-reserved` the same way
as the [official AMIs] do which is dependent on the instance type.

Reserved memory and cpu are set according to a formula while the storage
is always set to 1GiB. See the source code for details.

Instance type information (such as available storage, memory, and cpu)
may not only change in the future but also new instances will be added.
There is a make target `generate-kube-reserved` which fetches all instance
types by querying the AWS API `ec2:DescribeInstanceTypes` in each
region. It then saves it to `pkg/nodebootstrap/reserved_data.go` ready
to be taken as input for computing appropriate default values.

The list of AMIs to use for the static resolver is now generated
via go:generate. The list is queried from AWS and output to a code
file.

A separate makefile target called 'generate-ami' has been added that
runs go generate. The reason for a separate target is the fact that
AWS credentials are required for the code generation and this would
break the current workflow for the 'generate' target.

Another makefile target called 'ami-check' has been added. The
intended purpose of this by an automated scheduled process that
will run to check if new images are available.

Changed the the region logic so that if we create a AWS session
and there is no region from either the flags, aws shared config,
and aws environment variables then we re-create the session again
but specifying a default region. This is less than ideal but the
shared config isn't loaded until we create new session and the code
to read the shared config (ini files) is private.

A new issue will be opened to change this in the future to be cleaner
but we need a change to the AWS SDK first.

CloudFormation throws an error when attempting to submit a changeset to a
stack that contains no actual changes.  This can occur when you attempt to
scale a NodeGroup to the same size that it already is.  To work-around
that, we can detect if you're attempting to scale the NodeGroup to the
existing DesiredCapacity and turn that action into a no-op in order to
make this API call idempotent.

      --kubeconfig string        path to write kubeconfig (incompatible with --auto-kubeconfig) (default ""/Users/kuoka-yusuke/.kube/config"")
  -n, --name string              EKS cluster name (generated if unspecified, e.g. ""adorable-monster-1543548069"")
  -p, --profile string           AWS credentials profile to use (overrides the AWS_PROFILE environment variable)
      --set-kubeconfig-context   if true then current-context will be set in kubeconfig; if a context is already set then it will be overwritten (default true)
      --timeout duration         max wait time in any polling operations (default 20m0s)

The `--node-ami` flag has been added and can be used to supply an ami id to use. There are
2 special values that can be passed as well:

- 'static' which is the default and it will make sure the static
resolvers are used (which uses embedded image ids)
- 'auto' which instructs eksctl to use the 'auto' resolver (which queries AWS).

If neither of these special values are supplied to the flag then we take it as a excplicit AMI image id that should be used for the EKS nodes.

The 'static' and 'auto' resolvers can resolve instance types with GPU support (p2/p3) and use an AMI image that is optimized with GPU support. If using the GPU instances then the [NVIDIA device plugin](https://github.com/NVIDIA/k8s-device-plugin) will still need to be installed manually. Instructions are output. This will be an 'addon' in the future.

The ami's used for non-gpu instances have been updated to use the v23 version of the images. Also added the image for eu-west-1.

The static resolvers use maps to aid future go generate code which will aid #49.

After changing the AMIs to v23 a change has been made to use aws-iam-authenticator instead of heptio-authenticator-aws.

Also, AMI resolution is done earlier before the stack is started to be built...fail fast. Also added code to check the resolved image exists.

Prior to adding 'create/get/delete nodegroup' some refactoring
has been done on the commands. We had a single file for all
the commands for that verb so this has been changed to separate

When the cluster-autoscaler adds a new node to a group, it grabs an
existing node in the group and builds a ""template"" to launch a new node
identical to the one it grabbed from the group.

However, when scaling up from 0 there aren't any live nodes to reference to
build this template.  Instead, the cluster-autoscaler relies on tags in the
ASG to build the new node template.  This can cause unexpected behavior if
the pods triggering the scale-out are using node selectors or taints; CA
doesn't have sufficient information to decide if a new node launched in the
group will satisfy the request.

The long and short of it is that for CA to do its job properly we must tag
our ASGs corresponding to our labels and taints.  Add a note in the docs
about this since scaling up from 0 is a fairly common use case.

* Extract duplicate logic to RawResource#exists

Keeping things DRY should help with readability, reusability,
quality, etc.

* Add RawResource#Delete

* Add RawClient#Delete

* Add RawResource#Exists

* Add RawClient#Exists

* Installing Flux now deletes pre-existing resources

... prior to creating them again.

Indeed, the user's first installation might have partially failed,
or the user may want to reinstall Flux for whatever reason, but the
current implementation fails on a 2nd installation.

This is because `CreateOrUpdate` is not idempotent and fails on the
more complex objects, with important values defaulted server-side
like `Service` objects' IP addresses.

An alternative approach would be to use `kubectl apply` but this
would introduce a dependency on `kubectl`.

Note that we do NOT delete Flux's private SSH key, so that the user
does not have to set up Flux's permissions again in his repository.

* (Re-)create Flux Helm secrets prior to (re-)creating Flux

Otherwise, upon a re-installation, Flux will start with old certs,
and `eksctl` then times out:

Note that the namespace is passed as it may be required before

Changes to ensure that AWS profiles are supported. This involved making
sure that the AWS config file is loaded (SharedConfigEnabled) and
also making sure we have a TokenProvider set.

Added an explicit --profile flag that can be used to explicity specify
which AWS profile you would like to use. This will override any profile
that you have specified via AWS_PROFILE.

If endpoints are being overriden then the credentials from the initial
session creation are shared with any subsequent session creation to
ensure that the tokens are shared (otherwise you may get multiple MFA
prompts).

A permissions boundary is an advanced IAM feature in which you set the
maximum permissions that an identity-based policy can grant to an IAM
entity; where those entities are either users or roles. When you set
a permissions boundary for an entity, the entity can perform only the
actions that are allowed by both its identity-based policies and its
permissions boundaries.

This is relevant for eksctl, because eksctl is capable of managing,
i.e., creating, updating and deleting, the identity-based resources
required to operate a kubernetes cluster on AWS. While it is possible
to create these identity entities outside of eksctl and provide them
as configuration options, this adds an additional burden on the end-user,
which it is preferable to avoid.

Support for providing a permissions boundary to the identity-based entities
has been added to eksctl by extending the configuration file primarily.
This decision was made based on the fact that serviceRoleARN for a cluster
is provided in a similar way today. The assumption here is that providing
a permissions boundary is not the common case, and should therefore not
pollute the CLI more than necessary.

* Added kubeReserved calculation support for mixed instance NodeGroups

Support for calculating CPU, RAM, and Storage reservations via
`kubeReserved` was added to eksctl in v0.16. However, it only supported
NodeGroups with a single instance type. ASGs can have multiple
instance types and were not included in the calculation.

This change enables calculation of kubeReserved for mixed instances too.
Since multiple instance types are supported it calculates the reservation
based on the smallest instance type in the distribution.

Additional kubeReserved tests covering unknown innstance types. The new tests
ensure that unknown instance types are properly ignored during calculation
of kubeReserved.

* Update userdocs/src/usage/customizing-the-kubelet.md

PR https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/pull/4911 fixed a bug where the `clusterName` parameter was not being used when obtaining a cluster's ownership for `get clusters`. The logic for checking owned clusters, however, relied on this behaviour, breaking the check for cluster ownership.

Currently, CloudFormation generates a role name that contains
a random suffix. However, in some use-cases a predetermined
role name is useful. For instance, when following a git-ops
workflow it might be necessary to include the serviceaccount
annotations for the IAM role ARNs in the manifest repo. With
random role names that can only be done after the role has
been created by eksctl. In addition, if the cluster should ever
get re-created all role ARNs would change which would then

Resolves #500

Manually verified to work by creating a new cluster and looking into node labels:

```console
$ k get no --show-labels
NAME                                             STATUS    ROLES     AGE       VERSION   LABELS
ip-10-1-11-239.ap-northeast-1.compute.internal   Ready     <none>    7m        v1.11.5   alpha.eksctl.io/cluster-name=staging-sre-1,alpha.eksctl.io/instance-id=i-08553f41b298f910e,alpha.eksctl.io/nodegroup-name=nodegroup1,beta.kubernetes.io/arch=amd64,beta.kubernetes.io/instance-type=t3.large,beta.kubernetes.io/os=linux,failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/region=ap-northeast-1,failure-domain.beta.kubernetes.io/zone=ap-northeast-1a,kubernetes.io/hostname=ip-10-1-11-239.ap-northeast-1.compute.internal
```

Each node's instance ID is set for the key `alpha.eksctl.io/instance-id`. Because the key is preficed with `alpha`, I'm fine with this being changed in a backward-incompatible way.

This should remain an useful feature until the instance-id-as-node-name feature is implemented in the upstream. See #509 to track the progress towards it.",112,8,0

Add a new field named `clusterDNS` that accepts the IP address to the DNS server used for all the internal/external DNS lookups a.k.a the `--cluster-dns` flag of `kubelet`.

```yaml
nodeGroups:
- name: nodegroup1
  clusterDNS: 169.254.20.10
  # snip
```

This, in combination with `k8s-dns-node-cache` deployed as a daemonset on your cluster, allows all the DNS lookups from your pods to firstly routed to the node-local DNS server, which adds more reliability.

The configuration key `clusterDNS` is intentionally made per-nodegroup, not per-cluster, so that you can selectively use the node-local DNS. It, in combination with the proper use of node labels/taints, allows you to test the node-local DNS in only a subet of your workload.
It would also be nice to add `clusterDNS` as a cluster-level config key later. But I believe it isn't a must-have in this change.

See the [cluster/addons/dns/nodelocaldns](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/tree/master/cluster/addons/dns/nodelocaldns) in the upstream repository for more details.

A concrete steps to enable node-local DNS would look like the below:

- Decide the which IP addr to be used for binding the node-local DNS. Typically this is `169.254.20.10`
- Add `clusterDNS: 169.254.20.10` to your nodegroup in the cluster config
- Deploy [nodelocaldns.yaml](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/cluster/addons/dns/nodelocaldns/nodelocaldns.yaml), replacing:
  `__PILLAR__LOCAL__DNS__` with `169.254.169.254`, `__PILLAR__DNS__DOMAIN__` with `cluster.local`, `__PILLAR__DNS__SERVER__` with [`10.100.0.10` or `172.20.0.10`](https://github.com/weaveworks/eksctl/blob/master/pkg/nodebootstrap/userdata.go#L87-L94) according to your VPC CIDR

It makes sense for the `options` DTO to be able to validate itself.
It also separate the ""what"" from the ""how"" of the validation logic, hence making `doApplyGitops` more readable.

* Add utility to check if dir is empty (+tests)

* Clean up: remove space, sort imports

* gitops apply: validate --output-path ASAP

* Fix typo/grammar in pkg/ctl/gitops/apply.go

Issue description:

Command `eksctl info` reported the wrong version info of `kubectl`

    $ eksctl info
    eksctl version: 0.97.0
    kubectl version: v4.5.4 # <---- it's actually the version of Kustomize.
    OS: darwin

    $ kubectl version --client --short
    Flag --short has been deprecated, and will be removed in the future. The --short output will become the default. # <---- stderr.
    Client Version: v1.24.0 # <---- what we really need
    Kustomize Version: v4.5.4

To resolve this issue, change to use `--output json` and retrieve version information from ""gitVersion"".

Unattended Flux installation (automatic addition of deploy key)

You don't need to manually add GitHub deploy keys anymore.

This feature enables you to install Flux via eksctl in an unattended way, by automatically creating GitHub deply key on cluster creation and on `eksctl enable repo`, and by automatically deleting the deploy key on cluster deletion.

All you need to use this feature is providing `GITHUB_TOKEN` that has access to your repository's deploy keys, and a standard cluster.yaml that contains a `git` configuration for installing Flux.

Usage:

```
$ eksctl create cluster -f cluster.yaml

eksctl automatically creates a deploy key named  `eksctl-REGION-NAME` from the public ssh key generated by Flux
```

```
$ eksctl delete cluster -f cluster.yaml

eksctl automatically deletes the deploy key named `eksctl-REGION-NAME` by calling GitHub API
```

```
$ eksctl enable repo -f cluster.yaml

eksctl automatically creates a deploy key named  `eksctl-REGION-NAME` from the public ssh key generated by Flux
```

Please also note that this feature has an extra ability to make the deploy key ""read-only"". With the read-only deploy key, If you prefer that, you can effectively block Flux from ever pushing commits to the repository.

This can be enabled by setting `git.readOnly` to `true` or passing `--readonly` to `eksctl enable repo`.

The current implementation is trying to determine the AMI for managed
node groups based on the AMI family value. This is incorrect because
utils.IsGPUInstanceType is expecting an instanceType value.

Therefore, when trying to create GPU managed node groups, it isn't
actually selecting the correct GPU AMI, and the creation is failing.
(Nodegroups fail to stabilize from an Internal Failure)

This is the current CF template being generated when the instance type
is `g4dn.4xlarge`:

```

Currently, AMIs published for EKS worker nodes are not immediately available for use with managed nodegroups. To work around this, this change uses the AWS EKS Nodegroup API and leaves the ReleaseVersion unset to allow the default behaviour of the API choosing the latest available AMI version.

This change also switches from updating the CloudFormation stack to using the UpdateNodegroupVersion API call, because with the ReleaseVersion no longer being set to the latest AMI release obtained via SSM, some other field must be updated in order to trigger a stack update. Rather than use a hack like updating a label on the nodegroup, we simply use the UpdateNodegroupVersion API call which also gives more control over the update process.",373,23,0

* Added Ubuntu 20.04 Image Support

Starting with EKS 1.18, the official Ubuntu EKS images are based on
Ubuntu 20.04 LTS (Focal). EKS 1.17 is the last release to use
Ubuntu 18.04 LTS (Bionic) as a base.

There are two key changes included:

* Add CLI support for the Ubuntu2004 family
* Create a new bootstrap script specific to Ubuntu2004

Ubuntu 20.04 EKS images, are no longer disabling the
systemd-resolved's DNS stub listener. Without this, the CoreDNS will
assume there is a loop when trying to incorrectly use
/etc/resolv.conf.

* Add automated tests to api for Ubuntu2004 family

* Improve amiFamily JSON schema

* Reduce duplication

* Make sure Ubuntu1804/2004 finds correct images

Otherwise the consequence would be a failing pod in China regions

`eksctl` now allows you to manage any number of nodegroups other than the initial nodegroup.

Changes:

- `eksctl create nodegroup --cluster CLUSTER_NAME [NODEGROUP_NAME]` is added

  Creates an additional nodegroup.
  The nodegroup name is randomly generated when omitted.

- `eksctl get nodegroup --cluster CLUSTER_NAME` is added

  Lists all the nodegroups including the initial one and the additional ones.

- `eksctl delete nodegroup --cluster CLUSTER_NAME NODEGROUP_NAME` is added

  Deletes a nodegroup by name.

- `eksctl create cluster` has been changed to accept an optional `--nodegroup NODEGROUP_NAME` that specifies the nodegroup name.

- `eksctl delete cluster CLUSTER_NAME` has been changed to recursively delete all the nodegroups including additional ones.

- `eksctl scale nodegroup --cluster CLUSTER_NAME NODEGROUP_NAME` has been changed to accept the target nodegroup name as the second argument

Checklist:

- [x] Code compiles correctly (i.e `make build`)
- [x] Added tests that cover your change (if possible)
- [x] All tests passing (i.e. `make test`)
- Added/modified documentation as required (such as the README)
- Added yourself to the `humans.txt` file

This change was made to allow people to be able to define a KeyName
without an ingress rule of port 22 open to the VPC being set as a side
effect. This feature is useful in the case where you want to manage
SSH access with your own seperate security group but you still want to
explicitly set the SSH key.

Changed the logic for defaults so that when you define an SSH key and
set SSH to disabled it will no longer set SSH to enabled.

Removed the requirement of having SSH.Allow set to true when defining the
PublicKeyName in the template.

* Added Propagation of ManagedNodeGroup Tags to their AutoScalingGroups

Changes	to ensure that AutoScalingGroups Tags are the same as their

All tags are copied from the ManagedNodeGroup to the AutoScalingGroup.
If the tags already exists, it is overridden.

This is the default behaviour (as it is for Unmanaged NodeGroup) and
can be enabled using propagateASGTags boolean configuration.

The region handling for the commands has changed. Previously, if
you didn't specify the region flag (-r/--region) then we would
default to us-west-2 even if you had a different region specified

we only default to us-west-2 if there is no region specified using the
flay AND there is no region coming from the AWS shared config /

This is an initial change towards avoiding deletion issues whenever
we end-up with dangling resources that got created while cluster was
in use, and didn't go away cleanly.

Here we introduce two things:
- `DeleteStack` checks if stack that is about to be deleted already
  has `DELETE_FAILED` status, and bails out if that's the case;
  this behaviour can be controller with `force` argument
- during cluster deletion, if we cannot delete a nodegroup right away,
  we go and try to cleanup danlging ENIs (which somehow didn't used
  to be an issue, but recently this started to cause failures in
  integration tests)
- at the moment, we only try to delete these interfaces during cluster
  deletion, and nodegroup deletion may still fail and we don't have
  cleanup/retry mode there yet",113,8,0

This change adds an `--xray-access` CLI flag, that when specified will
add an IAM policy to the node group IAM role. The IAM policy allows
outbound write access to AWS X-Ray.

The specific policy allows access to:
```
xray:PutTraceSegments
xray:PutTelemetryRecords
xray:GetSamplingRules
xray:GetSamplingTargets
xray:GetSamplingStatisticSummaries
```

This is useful, as AWS App Mesh (supported with `--appmesh-access` flag)
can optionally push metrics into AWS X-Ray. For an example of this see
the screenshots [here](https://github.com/PaulMaddox/aws-appmesh-helm).

ClusterResourceSet builds a CloudFormation template using the ClusterConfig as input and skips creation of certain resources if the user has supplied their own resource (e.g., ClusterConfig.VPC.SecurityGroup) This works fine during cluster creation.

During an update, the VPC fields in ClusterConfig supplied by the user are ignored because user-supplied updates to VPC are not (yet) supported. However, before building a new template, the code loads the VPC config from the existing cluster's stack output, which results in ClusterResourceSet skipping execution of code that'd otherwise be executed when these fields aren't supplied by the user. As a consequence, any update logic that adds code that's conditionally executed, depending on whether a field was user-supplied or not, will be skipped and the updated stack will not have the new resources.

This change fixes creating resources that are created when VPC.SecurityGroup and VPC.SharedNodeSecurityGroup are not user-supplied.",352,18,0

Prior to this commit, if an user was required to enter their SSH key's
credentials (e.g. if identities got removed from the SSH agent), but
wouldn't enter these within 20 seconds, then eksctl would fail and
the command would have to be re-run from scratch, which can be rather
frustrating, especially as credentials would have to be entered several
times during a gitops apply command, for example.

After this change, we no longer enforce a timeout on Git commands, so
eksctl will wait indefinitely for the end-user to enter their
credentials, and will then resume work from there once entered.",237,15,0

When IAM AddOn Policy for EFS is set to true the policy is generated
specifying a wrong (fake) resource ARN
`arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:us-west-2:123456789012:file-system/*`.

The resource ARN in the policy statement should be in the format of
`arn:aws:elasticfilesystem:<REGION>:<AWS_ACCOUNT>:file-system/*` or simply
allow all resources `*` as is being done in the other addons like the EBS
one.

upstream Flux

* gofmt -s -w pkg/ctl/install/install.go

* Address code review: use CreateOrUpdate instead of kubectl

* Address code review: improve use of RawExtensions and CreateOrUpdate

* Address code review: improved output of eksctl help install flux

* Address code review: rename import: k8serrors -> apierrors

... in order to follow the same conventions as elsewhere in the codebase.

* Address code review: add more context to comments?

* Address code review: clearer command description?

* Address code review: explain why we return Flux's SSH key

* Rename kubernetes.JoinManifest* to ConcatManifest*

... and also change ConcatManifests to become a variadic function, since more flexible to use.

* Add utilities to generate Kubernetes Namespace objects (+tests)

* Use kubernetes.Manifest{,YAML} utilities to install Flux

* Address code review: extract check of existence of namespace

+ update comments

* Address code review: re-read manifests once amended

* Create the Flux namespace in the same way as all other resources

* Fix rebase: GetCredentials -> RefreshClusterConfig

* Add pkg/kubernetes/client.go#RawClient#ClientOrUpdate higher-level method

This should hopefully make it easier to leverage RawClient for simpler cases.",190,14,0

Currently all nodegroups are drained in serial but the nodes in each node group
are drained in parallel.  This change updates this logic to drain all nodes
across all node groups in parallel - up a maximum defined by the --parallel
flag.

This significantly speeds up draining for clusters with a large number of small
node groups.  Especially if some of the nodes in these node groups take longer
to drain than others.

This has the side affect of cordoning all nodes in all node groups before
beginning the actual draining process.  This should be the preferred behaviour
but may come as a surprise to some users - especially those that assume the
cordoning is actually the node being drained.

This is to avoid printing usage/help on genuine runtime errors.
However, a side effect of this is that we now also no longer print
usage/help on input validation errors either.

That being said, given:

- we're trying to sanitise/simplify `eksctl`'s code at the moment,
- other CLI also do NOT print any usage/help on input validation errors
  e.g. `kubectl`,

it was decided between Martina, Chetan and I that it didn't matter too
much for now.",350,19,0

This adds two flags and one nodegroup config key to `eksctl`:

- `--node-role-policies` for replacing the whole set of IAM policies associated to the eksctl-managed node role.
  This just exposes the existing configuration key `attachPolicyARNs` for a little ease-of-use, like other advanced flags.
- `--node-role-name` for specifying the exact name of the IAM role for nodes, as well as the corresponding nodegroup config key `instanceRoleName`. This implicitly enable the `NamedIAM` cfn capability.

The flags are marked hidden show that they are not shown in the command help. This is done to make it easier to be removed in near future.

This commit introduces a new MaxPodsPerNode property on InstanceTypeInfo and populates it
using the data from maxpods.go so that it will be available for calculating the default memory
to reserve. It removes the Memory property from InstanceTypeInfo because it is no longer needed.

This commit also updates related unit tests. It fixes some unit tests which reference instance types which no
longer exist and adds a check to make sure instance types which are expected to exist actually exist, and those
which are not expected to exist do not exist.

* Add pkg/git/Options#ValidateURL (+tests)

To have all the validation logic on the `Options` `struct` itself,
instead of being scattered across commands' `main`s.
This should also help enforcing consistency across commands.

* install flux no longer duplicates pkg/git/Options

Before this commit, `eksctl install flux` was using a configuration
`struct` which had the same fields as `pkg/git/Options`, but
flattened. There is no good reason for such duplication, especially
as business logic is being added to `pkg/git/Options` to validates
its fields: let's keep things DRY!

* install flux & apply gitops now validate with git.Options.ValidateURL

... instead of each having their own currently weak, and duplicated
input validation logic.
This helps enforce consistency across commands, hence improving the
UX, while also reducing the chances of having invalid input making it
through.

* More consistent flag description for Git SSH URL

... `install flux` & `apply gitops`.
This should help clarify to the end user that `eksctl` currently only
supports SSH Git URLs, and provides an example of the accepted format.

* No colon after e.g.

* Use errors.Wrap instead of Wrapf where possible

* Use giturls.Parse to check the scheme is SSH/Git",237,15,0

* Implement dumpLogsToDisk function

Since we want to dump logs to disk only in the event of failure, we need to buffer the logs until a failure is encountered. This buffer (logBuffer) is provided as a writer to the logger library, and the output is mulit-written to this buffer and the original destination. For better organization purpose, the failure logs are stored in a newly created ""logs/"" directory, and are timestamped.

* Add debug log directory path to gitignore

The log directory and it's contents are created for debug purposes. No need for this to remain in the repo.

* Add actual error message to dumped file

* Dump logs to disk on failure integration test

A `eksctl get --name <does_not_exist>` command is run, with assertions.
These assertions check if the code exits with status 1, and if a new
failure log file is generated. The code also performs necessary cleanup.

* Improved error handling

- Inline handling of errors for consistency
- Using logger instead of fmt.Println for printing error info to stdout

* Create only one log file per day

- Instead of new file for each failure, have one log file per day
- This file will contain a timestamped version of the logs and error
   message for a particular day
- Reduces clutter in the generated files, and makes logs easier to find

* Make dump logs to disk opt-in

- Use -d flag to enable dump logs to disk during failure
- Updated integration test to reflect this behaviour

* Removing underscore from integration test package

Initial version of nodegroup scaling has been added. This scales
by modifying the CloudFormation template for the nodegroup. The
modified template is used to create a changeset that is then
executed.

When scaling down/in (i.e. reducing the number of nodes) we rely
solely on the the resulting change to the ASG. This means that
the node(s) that are to be terminated aren't drained and so pods
running on the terminating nodes may cause errors. In the future
we may consider picking the EC2 instances to be terminated and then
drain the nodes and then create a termination policy to ensure those
nodes are killed.

When writing the kubeconfig for the new EKS cluster then the following
will happen:
- If --kubeconfig, --auto-kubeconfig or KUBECONFING env var are NOT set
  then the default kube config location will be used (~/.kube/conf).
- If KUBECONFIG is set then we use this (assuming --kubeconfig and
  --auto-kubeconfig aren't specified).
- if KUBECONFIG is set BUT --kubeconfig or --auto-kubeconfig are
  specified then KUBECONFIG will be ignored.
- if a kubeconfig file already exists then we merge in the new EKS
  cluster details with the existing file.
- If `set-context` is true then the current-context will be set to that
  of the new EKS cluster.
- If `set-context` is false (default) then if we are merging with an
  existing configuration file with a current-context set then this won't
  be updated.
- If there is no existing configuration file then current-context will
  be set even if `set-context` is false.
