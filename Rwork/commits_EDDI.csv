This would re-phrase the output in terms of your rebuy and would change the savings criteria to require saving either at least 2% on your ship's value or 0.1% on the your total credit balance).

Verified that shipmonitor.json is being updated, EDDI's UI is being updated, and that no exceptions are thrown. :-)

- The shipyard now uses BindingOperations.EnableCollectionSynchronization to synchronize the collection between threads (note that the shipmonitor is not run on the same thread when used as a plugin from VoiceAttack and requires the use of the dispatcher to initiate the sync.
- Removed `uiSyncContext`. No longer required.
- Added `ShipyardUpdatedEvent`. This can be used to ""force"" a UI refresh (though it typically is not needed)
- Revised sequencing to prevent a lock from being called while already inside a lock. 
- Unrelated improvement: The `refreshProfileDelayed` method is now an async Task method, rather than an async void method.",43,7,0

4. Add commodity pass-through objects to applicable event definitions to allow passing commodity object data (like ednames) from events to the cargo monitor
5. Revise localizedName property in ResourceBasedLocalizedEDNames.cs to allow a localizedName to be set **if** it is null (this allows us to take advantage of localized names from the journal, including for powerplay).",38,9,0

    * Fixed a bug that temporarily stripped community goal missions from the mission list.
    * Fixed a bug that prevented community goal missions from sometimes being identified as community goal missions.

- Revises the material so that it consistently uses the edname as a key, rather than using a mixture of the material name and the material edname (collectively: material). Add edname to the json.
- Preserves current user settings while converting to the new edname version of the json
- Adds a DeprecatedMaterials function to Materials.cs to identify and prune old data (this will be obsolete / no longer required once everyone is transitioned from the current json format)
- Revises logic to make the materialsmonitor more ""self-healing"". The 1st time is is run it'll add an EDName to all of the entries in materialmonitor.json. The 2nd time, it'll identify any entries with the duplicate EDNames and select entries such that only one EDName shall be allowed for each material.

"EDCD/EDDI","b21428bef9b6e4be372ac578c905fa8fb9e30898","Tkael","2019-01-24 07:43:47","false","Improve handling of module events when shipyard contains minimal or no ship definition.

- Fixes #1106
- If the shipyard does not contain a ship with a local id matching the event, create a basic ship from the event to receive the event data, pulling in ship definitions (like military compartment sizes).
- Revise `AddModule` and `RemoveModule` events to ensure any exception results in no change.
- Add an appropriate test.
