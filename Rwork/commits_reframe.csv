there is on call to printer.verbose in the entire code. The former is
related to a module not being properly loaded, which is difficult to
reproduce, since we do have correct checks on ReFrame.

- We warn on system, partition and environment redefinitions

- All sections with unnamed objects are merged and resolved based on the
  selected system. As a result, this sections can be combined arbitrarily through
  as the chain of configuration files is loaded and the resulting internal config
  will always has a single such object, so that it is guaranteed that calls, such
  as `get('general/0/<option>')` will always yield the correct value.

- Add a special section named `handlers$` that contains the basic stream handler
  that handles the framework's output. This allows users to override the
  standard `handlers` without having to override the basic output handler.

- Only a single stdout and stderr stream handler is considered and if a second
  one is defined this is silently ignored. This was done primarily for
  backward compatibility with the current user configurations, so that their
  framework stdout handler in `handlers` will be simply ignored in favor of the
  one in the special section `handlers$`.

- Unit tests were updated and cleaned up.

A laptop would generally not have modules, so saying that explicitly
will help highlight to new users that a module setting can be
useful. There is a modules setting below for daint, but at least one
user skimmed over the more complex case.

are greater than 15, and a range including 15 is shown, then the
highlighting can need a bump. Note that the latter index within the
range shown, so don't always need a bump.

1. The performance of the test is no more logged from within the test inside the
   `check_performance()` method, but instead it is logged through the associated
   task from test executor _after_ the test has finished. This allows us to log
   also the final test result by introducing the new `check_result` test
   attribute.

2. Performance logging through the `filelog` handler is completely revised:
   - All performance variables are logged at once in a single line.
   - A new option named `format_perfvars` is introduced for formatting the
     performance variables. This will be used to format the
     `%(check_perfvalues)s` specifier.
   - The handler will now emit a header line describing what each logged field
     is. This header is not generic, but it gets its information from the record
     itself, in order to obtain the name of the performance variables that are
     being logged.
   - To ensure consistency of the produced log files, if a header is changed in
     a subsequent run of the same test (e.g., the format or the
     performance variables changed), a new file will be generated and the old
     one will be saved.
   - The `filelog` handler in generic settings was adapted accordingly and it
     now produces pure csv output, so that it can be easily imported in other
     tools for visualization.",20,65,1
