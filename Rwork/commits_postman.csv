# Faker NPM package back on track after malicious coding incident

In the wake of a recent incident that wreaked havoc on the NPM package
registry, a new group of maintainers is reestablishing the Faker
project, making it a community effort. The previous maintainer had
sabotaged the Faker NPM package with malicious code, impacting more than
2,500 other NPM packages that depend on it.

The Faker JavaScript library generates mock data for testing and
development. A group of engineers has created a [GitHub
repo](https://github.com/faker-js/faker) for the new Faker package and
released previous versions at @faker-js/faker
on [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker).

On January 4, the previous maintainer committed malicious code to the
Faker and colors libraries, causing an [infinite loop that impacted
thousands of
projects](https://www.bleepingcomputer.com/news/security/dev-corrupts-npm-libs-colors-and-faker-breaking-thousands-of-apps/).
In response, GitHub, which oversees NPM, removed the malicious Faker and
colors packages and suspended the user account in accordance with NPM
malware policy. A [security
advisory](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5rqg-jm4f-cqx7) pertaining
to colors was published, as well.

Faker was first implemented in Perl in 2004. In a January
14 [bulletin](https://fakerjs.dev/update.html#what-is-faker), the new
maintainers announced a plan to improve Faker and released a version 6.x
alpha. Items on the roadmap include:

The Faker and colors incident was not the first time NPM had been
impacted by dependencies among packages. In 2016, a
developer’s [unpublishing of a small JavaScript
package](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3047177/how-one-yanked-javascript-package-wreaked-havoc.html) broke
dependencies for many other projects.",4,72,1

There are a few methods missing from the `pm.*` API that needed to be included in the Learning Center documentation. Also, a rename of an existing method was required as this was causing confusion.
- `pm.request.method` was missing and is part of the `pm.request` object.
- `pm.request.body` mentioned in this issue https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-docs/issues/1994
- `pm.request.headers.delete()` This was incorrect and should have been `.remove()` 
- `pm.response.reason()` This was renamed to `.status`
- `pm.response.responseSize` This was missing from the documentation
-  Included the `.replaceIn()` function to each variable scope as this was missing from the documentation. https://github.com/postmanlabs/postman-docs/issues/2181",61,48,1
