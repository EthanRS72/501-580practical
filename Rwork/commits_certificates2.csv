When validating an ACME challenge (`device-attest-01` in this case,
but it's also true for others), and validation fails, the CA didn't
return a lot of information about why the challenge had failed. By
introducing the ACME `Subproblem` type, an ACME `Error` can include
some additional information about what went wrong when validating
the challenge.

This is a WIP commit. The `Subproblem` isn't created in many code
paths yet, just for the `step` format at the moment. Will probably
follow up with some more improvements to how the ACME error is
handled. Also need to cleanup some debug things (q.Q)",10,51,1,1,"2018-11-01 03:55:16","1546.35"

It supports renewing X.509 certificates when an RA is configured with stepcas.
This will only work when the renewal uses a token, and it won't work with mTLS.

The audience cannot be properly verified when an RA is used, to avoid this we
will get from the database if an RA was used to issue the initial certificate
and we will accept the renew token.

Azure caches tokens for 24h and we cannot issue a new certificate

The meaning of this parameter is to allow the signing of multiple
certificate in one instance. This is possible in GCP, because we
get a new token, and is possible in AWS because we can generate
a new one. On Azure there was no other way to do it unless you
wait for 24h.

RFC 8555 § 7.3.5 is not listed as optional but we do not currently

The notImplmented error type is not an official error registered in the
ietf:params:acme:error namespace, so prefix if with step:acme:error. An
ACME server is allowed to return other errors and clients should display

A server without TLS was added to serve the SCEP endpoints. According
to the RFC, SCEP has to be served via HTTP. The `sscep` client, for
example, will stop any URL that does not start with `http://` from
being used, so serving SCEP seems to be the right way to do it.

This commit adds a second server for which no TLS configuration is
configured. A distinct field in the configuration, `insecureAddress`
was added to specify the address for the insecure server.

The SCEP endpoints will also still be served via HTTPS. Some clients
may be able to work with that.

This commit also improves how the crypto.Decrypter interface is
handled for the different types of KMSes supported by step. The
apiv1.Decrypter interface was added. Currently only SoftKMS
implements this interface, providing a crypto.Decrypter required
for SCEP operations.",21,28,0,1,"2018-11-01 03:55:16","861.89"

This adds a new KMS, SSHAgentKMS, which is a KMS to provide signing keys
for issuing ssh certificates signed by a key managed by a ssh-agent. It
uses the golang.org/x/crypto package to get a native Go implementation
to talk to a ssh-agent.

This was primarly written to be able to use gpg-agent to provide the
keys stored in a YubiKeys openpgp interface, but can be used for other
setups like proxying a ssh-agent over network.

That way the signing key for ssh certificates can be kept in a
""sign-only"" hsm.

This code was written for my employer Intinor AB, but for simplicity
sake gifted to me to contribute upstream.

The first super admin subject can now be provided through the
`--admin-subject` flag when initializing a CA.

It's not yet possible to configure the subject of the first
super admin when provisioners are migrated from `ca.json` to the
database. This effectively limits usage of the flag to scenarios
in which the provisioners are written to the database immediately,
so when `--remote-management` is enabled. It currently also doesn't
work with Helm deployments, because there's no mechanism yet to
pass this type of option to the Helm chart.

This package wasn't upgraded in certificates and for some reason it

works as expected.

Before this commit, EAB keys could be used CA-wide, meaning that
an EAB credential could be used at any ACME provisioner. This
commit changes that behavior, so that EAB credentials are now
intended to be used with a specific ACME provisioner. I think
that makes sense, because from the perspective of an ACME client
the provisioner is like a distinct CA.

Besides that this commit also includes the first tests for EAB.
The logic for creating the EAB JWS as a client has been taken
from github.com/mholt/acmez. This logic may be moved or otherwise
sourced (i.e. from a vendor) as soon as the step client also
(needs to) support(s) EAB with ACME.",18,33,0,1,"2018-11-01 03:55:16","1008.69"

Apparently the macOS SCEP client sends a SCEP message in the query
that's not fully escaped. Only the base64 padding is escaped, the
'+' and '/' characters aren't.

This is a bit of a special case, because the macOS SCEP client
will default to using HTTP POST for the PKIOperation. But if the
CA is configured without the POSTPKIOperation capability, the
macOS SCEP client will use HTTP GET instead. This behavior might
be the same on iOS.",0,59,1,1,"2018-11-01 03:55:16","1794.31"

This commit adds some changes to PR #731, some of them are:
- Add distribution point to the CRL
- Properly stop the goroutine that generates the CRLs
- CRL config validation
- Remove expired certificates from the CRL
- Require enable set to true to generate a CRL

This last point is the principal change in behaviour from the previous
implementation. The CRL will not be generated if it's not enabled, and
if it is enabled it will always be regenerated at some point, not only
if there is a revocation.",15,48,1,1,"2018-11-01 03:55:16","1451.67"

An unfortunate combination of `--provisioner acme` and the `--acme`
flags on `step ca init` could lead to an invalidat CA configuration.
This commit prevent this case from happening. A similar error could
occur for the `sshpop` provisioner, so a fix was implemented for that
case too.

The fix doesn't catch all cases, e.g. it doesn't check for multiple
provisioners having the same `acme-` or `sshpop-` prefix. The code
that is called is intended to be only called from a `step ca init`
invocation, so should work for these cases, but might not if the
methods are invoked at other times.",0,59,1,1,"2018-11-01 03:55:16","1792.32"

A server without TLS was added to serve the SCEP endpoints. According
to the RFC, SCEP has to be served via HTTP. The `sscep` client, for
example, will stop any URL that does not start with `http://` from
being used, so serving SCEP seems to be the right way to do it.

This commit adds a second server for which no TLS configuration is
configured. A distinct field in the configuration, `insecureAddress`
was added to specify the address for the insecure server.

The SCEP endpoints will also still be served via HTTPS. Some clients
may be able to work with that.

This commit also improves how the crypto.Decrypter interface is
handled for the different types of KMSes supported by step. The
apiv1.Decrypter interface was added. Currently only SoftKMS
implements this interface, providing a crypto.Decrypter required
for SCEP operations.",21,28,0,1,"2018-11-01 03:55:16","861.89"

Although it is not recommended to use any character in a username,
it is possible to create and use them. The tool useradd has the flag
--badname and adduser has --allow-badname and --allow-all-names to
create new users with any character.

Moreover, it is possible to create any username with the rest of
