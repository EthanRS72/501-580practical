* Remove Babiri from Enigma pool

Forgot to update this, since now Babiri will stop mutations when fully grown.

* Change queuedAuraReset to trigger in next 2 ticks

Seems like just queuing the reset after a tick isn't enough, so I changed it to 2. This seems to work on my end.

* Only trigger unlocks/stats with positive amounts

Hidden bug, as we don't currently use gainBerry for anything other than positive amounts.

* Modify Kasib Effect (again)

Kasib effect was way too much, and made Petaya too hard to get.

* Add info tooltip for external auras

* Fix MarangaTreeTaller image

* Added Sewaddle and Karrablast to base wandering pokemon

* Add Unova Starters to wanderers

* Rayquaza

Rayquaza was increased from 2 bosses to 4 to balance it in line with Celebi. encounters to replace the new bosses are from ORAS

* Azelf, Uxie and Giratina

Saturn, Jupiter and Cyrus have their weights increased to 2 to make Azelf, Uxie and Giratina 1 in 3 (arbitrary minimum maintained from Johto onwards). Grisious orb chance is balanced accordingly (with a slight boost)

* Darkrai

Adds 2 bosses to Newmoon Island.
Fixes error in Brelooms HP in Flower Paradise. Also added Lunatone to Fullmoon Island to match Newmoon Island

* Regigigas

Adds Steelix from DP as a boss to Snowpoint Temple

* Heatran and Volcarona

Moves Camerupt to be a boss in Stark Mountain.
Increases Perry's weight to 2 (Volcarona is the only non legendary pokemon that will be affected by this PR, due to being treated as one in some cases)

* Terrakion

Decreased Victory Road Unova down to 3 bosses so Terrakion matches Coballion and Virizion

* Reshiram and Zekrom

Increased Dragonspiral Tower to 4 bosses, changed DNA chance accordingly

* Keldeo (Resolute)

Added 2 bosses to Pledge Grove

* Genesect

I have no idea what went wrong with this dungeon. almost all the encounters were non canon despite having plenty canon encounters. Also decreased the bosses to 5. Still quite high, but not utterly ridiculous as it used to be

* Diancie and Volcanion

Increased Emil, Monique and Aliana's weights to give the dungeons a total weight of 4 (the arbitrary minimum I am using for most (if not all) legendaries from Kalos onward)

* Necrozma, Cosmog, Cosmoem, Solgaleo, Lunala

Added Golbat to Mount Lanakila to keep it at a higher boss count than Lake of the Sunne and Moone, and put it on the same level as Kyurem.
Added Solrock and Lunatone as bosses in Lake of the Sunne and Moone before Cosmog is captured, and Cosmoem after it is captured. Changed the chance of Light items accordingly
Removed Forretress from P2 Lab as non canon

* Tapu Koko, Tapu Lele, Tapu Bulu, Tapu Fini

Added pokemon that match the tapus types to their boss list. Removed these pokemon from the regular list  (and Gloom, to keep the number matching)

* Guzzlord

Added Zygarde to Resolution Cave

* Change Cosmog fodder to Minior

* Xerneas and Yveltal

updated to be slightly rarer due to their hightened catch rates

* Safari Animation Tiers

Testing some values to speed up the Safari animations. For now I have tiers at 0, 10, 20, 30, 40; where 0 keeps the speed as is (level 1) and 40 has maximum speed at around a little faster than double speed. This is just a test for now.

* You Run at 20 Now

30 was too high to learn to run. Now you learn at 20. Congratulations!

* Eslint

I always forget to run this thing. Good thing I remembered before doing anything else.

* Roll Animation

Ah! I forgot the roll animation. Fixed.

* Some small fixes

Forgot to speed up the fleeing animation. Without it, it was possible to take an extra turn. That's NOT good. Made bounce choose between 2 fixed values since the normal multiplier broke the animations. Since running shoes are at 20, then this value also changes at 20.

Speed transition between these phases CANNOT be sped up so that one stays at 0.75s.

* Ball Animation Fix

Like previous instance, some animations cannot be too fast.

Some animations breaking happen even at normal speed so I can't fix everything.

I failed for now but I'll fix it later.

* Ball animation fix 2

Yay found the culprit. It seems I cannot move those ones or the animation explodes! Excellent. Getting close to the end.

* Last Tier back to 0.45

Now that I'm aware that it wasn't that low value, it can safely go back to that one.

* Small fix

Ok with this it seems the animation bug doesn't happen now.

* Stuck to walking for now

* Fix Hondew mutation

* Nerf Flavor Mutations again.

This should stop the first flavors from being too crazy.

* Update Enigma Mutation

Will now use 3rd and 4th gen berries only, so people with the unfornate chance of getting Cheri won't happen.

Also fixed issue where Enigma could index into 67, which doesn't exist.

* Fix Hondew Requirements

* Remove debug multiplier (woops)

* Fix wording to be a bit more clear

* Another Mutation balance change

Change flavor mutation max back to 80, as the new mutation chance scaling fixes the invasion issue.
Changed Tamato mutation since I want Lum to be a special berry (and also not block any mutation progress)
Change Occa to use Razz, since Cheri is annoying to mutate with.
Added TODOs for after Party Slot implementation.

* Reduce base wander pokemon for a higher chance of unique wanders.

The additional pokemon will just be annoying.

* Balancing Auras and Wandering Pokemon.

* Remove Berry Pokemon from PalPark

* Added Wandering Pokemon to help tab

* Minor timing modifications

To aid a bit in early mutations

* Update Farming.ts

* Re-add Pal Park pokemon

* Update src/scripts/farming/mutation/mutationTypes/GrowNearFlavorMutation.ts

* Fix coin image for Oak Items Display

* Increment Berry harvest statistic on withers as well

* Remove Combee from Shop

Now will be Berry Exclusive.

Technically Burmy and Cherrubi can also be gotten from the farm, but not sure if we want a lot of exclusives in the farm, that might be annoying.

* Fix Maranga Mutation

* Refactor flavor evolutions

A bit harder to get now

* Hide locked berries in Berry Master Trades

* Boost Mutation rate for Second Gen

Should make them a bit easier than the first flavor mutations now, which seem to be the first mutations the player gets at the moment.

* Fixing Mulches (again)

* Fixing Mutations and also fixing Berry Quests

Some mutations were crashing. Thankfully no one's reached them yet.

Also fixed quests to only have unlocked berries and also balanced reward.

* Implement Enigma Mutation Hint

* Change to region locked instead

* Revert ""Remove Combee from Shop""

This reverts commit d51649cd24fe69dbf682734c3a7c74d10459c66c.

* Add starters to wandering pokemon

* Fix Wepear stage time

* Bump Berry ID by 1 so Cheri gets #01

* Fix for Berry Statistics Modal

* Fix updating Kanto  Berry Master hint every day

* Add mulch description tooltips on mulch list

* Remove tooltips when not visible

Seems to fix some of the lag issues.

* Simplify fix

Now the clicks will work correctly since it's still on the same element. Now the plots are just removed entirely when the farmView isn't visible.

* Revert ""Simplify fix""

This reverts commit 3e545074aee3d539b5a680acc28dda0b514bd81e.

* Revert ""Remove tooltips when not visible""

This reverts commit 2cd98436134fd72dfa13b8d132376fa04a235136.

* Remove show function

This was causing the lag after hovering over tooltips too many times. The tooltips weren't being handled properly afterwards, which caused popper.js to attempt to reposition them when scrolling, which caused the lag.

* Sprout Tower

* Ruins of Alph

* Union Cave

Since the wild Pokémon only cover floor 1F I decided to do the same with the trainers. Saved me a bunch of work, which is nice.

* Update Dungeon.ts

* Slowpoke Well

* Update Dungeon.ts

* Ilex Forest

It's Wayne the Crystal-exclusive bug catcher! Also fixed up weights in Alph.

* Mt Mortar

Locked Tyrogue behind one Mt Mortar clear. The new boss Kiyo is the one that would give you Tyrogue in GSC, so it now requires beating him at least once.

Not that it matters much, just hatch it from a fighting egg or breed the hitmons lol.

* Burned Tower

Just a small Pokémon order fix. Turns out none of the trainers here exist in Crystal version. Except the rival. But that's a whole different story.

* Dark Cave

No trainers, just a small pokémon order change. Also added an entrance on route 31. Similar situation to Diglett Cave. Opens the door for potential future dark cave shenanigans.

* Team Rockets Hideout

* Get rid of some dangly commas

* Radio Tower

I have used my absolute lack of artistic skills to put it on the map too. How nice.

* Update JohtoSVG.html

Radio Tower slightly too wide oops.

* Surprise Victory Road!

Also fixed the Indigo Plateau Johto requirement. I left some room north of the new Victory Road dungeon to maybe at some point filt rival Silver in there.

* Add some dangly commas

* Update environments

* A li'l reward for completing the Radio Tower.

* Update QuestLineHelper.ts

* Pimped Goldenrod up a bit

* Change the quest to include the Hideout

* Fix commas and spaces

* Start the Radio Tower Takeover questline if already past that point

* Merge branch 'develop' into Shovel_mulch

First commit introducing Mulch Shovel.
Current issues :
- Display isn't nice, I've opted for a display in the Mulch list but it's not of the right size and kinda weird. Any idea on what's best for the display is more than welcome :)
- I'm still unsure if MulchShovelItem class definition should have its own file, I'd need some input on this :)
- I'm really bad with art... so I did not make another shovel art. If anyone can use anything better than Paint, I'm all in for it !

* Changes that should'nt be included

IDE changed ident when I didn't mean it to...

* Update Mulch_Shovel.png

Special thx to NiceDice !

* Update following feedbacks on review

- Mulch shovel is now displayed in mulch tab when berry shovel is in berry tab.
- You can shovel an empty spot (I prevented it before but it seems better to be able to)

* Mulch shovel now increases the Shovel statistic

* Add mulch shovel cursor

* feat(typescript): initial work to support TypeScript modules

This is the initial split of our code from `./src/scripts` (old code
that assumes classes and types are global variables) to `./src/modules`
(TypeScript code using import/export). The main goal of this is to allow
us to gain full typechecking and bundling benefits, and to reduce the
circular dependencies that have only been allowed to exist due to the
order in which code runs.

* feat(typescript): move Statistics into TS module

* chore(ci): ensure the code is tested with modules+scripts

* fix(typescript): fix paths so gulp works in Windows

* chore(typescript): clean declarations before generating new ones

If a module is moved or deleted, the declaration will cause scripts to
crash due to duplicate declarations. By cleaning the declarations
directory prior to generating them, we will ensure there are only the
most up-to-date declarations available",52,40,0

* Swapped access order for Ecruteak gym access and Legendary Beasts

To stay true to the main games, it is now required to pass route 37 to start the Legendary Beasts questline and requires beating Silver inside said questline in order to challenge Morty's gym. The only thing I'm unsure of, and hopefully whoever checks this knows more than me, is if the quest should no longer be a bulletin board quest if it's required for progression. If so, I can attempt to change it.

* Update QuestLineHelper.ts

* Updated for no Bulletin Board

Swapped the req to start the quest from Bulletin Board to Sudowoodo (I couldn't get it to activate on route 37 clear for whatever reason)

* Updated to Lucho's suggestion

Instead of having Morty's gym and the quest interact in any way, Lucho suggested simply making the legendary beasts quest active when route 37 is cleared as a bulletin which imo makes plenty of sense. This way, the beasts are still available pre-Morty but do not become a required quest that some people may not want to clear.

* Quest-related lag

Reduce lag and delay when starting, quitting, completing quests and refreshing the quest list

* Reduce hatchery helper lag

Helpers would sort the caught pokemon list every time they tried to grab an egg. Changed it to be a pureComputed to only sort when necessary.

BreedingController.visible() -> PartyPokemon.isHatchable()
This ended up being considerably faster as a pureComputed property on PartyPokemon than as a function returning a pureComputed

* More calculateTownCssClass optimizations

* Clean up

* Further optimization to hatchery helpers

Jess' suggestion that doesn't use sorting and only iterates through the caught pokemon list once is even faster than my solution

In Johto, before defeating Morty around Ecruteak, Mt. Mortar is unlocked, but Route 42, Mahogany Town, and Route 43 are not. In HGSS, it is possible to access Route 42 (namely it's grass for encounters), as well as everywhere else mentioned, in 2 ways. Either you can beat Morty and obtain Surf, or you can go through Mt. Mortar prior to beating Morty. You are not able to get to the Red Gyarados without Surf, so you still cannot start that questline.

Does not exist yet but will exist in the future, so this is just future proofing

Seems like someone butchered it trying to shorten it, as the original sprite was just a bit too tall to fit in the 80x80 resolution.

Another sprite made by DraK4y, putting it into this PR because it's just easier at this point

* The Route Re-order

Right now, RouteData has the weather encounters grouped by Weather which looks fine on paper but makes the Pokémon show up in multiple groups. Since the Wiki cares about Pokémon first, requirements later, it would be better to group all these Pokémon individually with their respective Weather requirements (unless some share the same requirements, then they are allowed to share the same array). By doing this, the Wiki will display the Pokémon just once in Special section of the Routes and, at the same time, it will also make Routes be displayed just once in the Pokémon pages, letting the tooltip take care of showing all the list of Weathers (and other Requirements if they exist) instead of multiple occurrences of the Pokémon / Route with one Weather type each.

This PR, then, seeks to do this reorder thus helping the Wiki display data without repeated entries. This first commit is from Rolling Fields to Loop Lagoon.

* Allow players to 'safe-lock' a specific plot by using shift + left-click in order to prevent shovel, harvest, and new mulch on this plot.

* Added: new _isSafeLocked property on the Plot.js class.

* Modified: FarmController.ts to be able to handle clicks & shift + clicked actions.

* Modified: Farming.ts methods (shovel(), harvest() & canMulch()) now take the new plot _isSafeLocked property into account.

* Added: new lock-sign icon on farmModal.html to notify players whether the plot is 'safe-locked' or not.

Added: new style for the lock-sign icon in farm.less

* Save locked plots

* Safe lock apply to planting and mulch shovel

* Lock SVG file

* Lock as a toggleable hotkey

* Add Solaceon Ruins

Added Solaceon Ruins with 4 unown types (solacen - discor = laen), 2 of them are brand spanking new. Also moved Hippopotas to these ruins. Reasoning for that is Hippopotas is currently on 214 because that's where the Maniac Tunnel is, which is the only place that has wild Hippopotas in all of Sinnoh. The tunnel does connect to some secret rooms in the Solaceon Ruins, so while the Maniac Tunnel is still not in the game (probably won't happen either), I think having Hippopotas in a dungeon makes sense, and having them in the Solaceon Ruins also makes sense.

Just putting items where they make sense. No idea what to put in Slowpoke Well, Dark Cave and Mt. Silver though.

Eventually, when this is done and every Johto dungeon has an item, we can put what remains on Shard traders. That way obtaining them still requires dungeons.

PLACEHOLDER WEIGHTS

* Newly added helditems are now shown

* More held items

All that's really left now is Dragon Fang. Victory Road is still open but that's kinda lame so maybe it's gonna be a shard thing instead or something like that IDK.

There's also still Hard Stone and Metal Coat which are an underground item and an evolution item so that's a whole thing.

Anyway, other than that all the type based items are now taken care of.

increased hoenn -> 22500k total
increased Sinnoh -> 33750k total
increased Unova -> 50625k total
Kalos -> non dex required available 
increased Alola -> 114k total
increased Galar -> 170k total

optional:
Meloetta -> unchanged
Furfrou (Dandy) -> reduced to 250k (reduced because a lot more is required in previous and later regions. Still a lot higher than Meloette because there is no other QP Pokémon in the Kalos region)


Not touching Eggs and Evo items. But that should already make QP a bit more important later in the game and slow down mid game progress.

* Fixed description of Dive Ball

Changed ""water routes"" to ""water environments"" since the Dive Ball works in more than just routes.

* Deleted route 41 in Water Environment list

I checked RouteData and saw that Alola 41 doesn't exist so I deleted it from the Water Environment list in GameConstants. 40 is the last one which corresponds to ""Master League Pier"".

* Gramma fix

For a while now we've been using two Hex Maniac sprites. The crappy gen 3 one in Hoenn and a way better custom one by Kyle-Dove (already credited) in Kalos. There's really no point in having two different sprites for the same trainer class, unless it's a real difference like male/female, so with this PR we now use the good custom one for all Hex Maniacs, and the crappy gen 3 sprites is removed.

Totems get an ""aura boost"". In the main series this results in 1 or 2 stages of increase into specific stats. A stage is 50%. So that's 50% or 100% boost. For the stats of the totems in clicker I've turned every 1 into +10, ever 2 into +20. Just added to the stats. No percentages. Can't go around doubling stats, considering these totems will be catchable.

* The Castform Shuffle

Base Castform removed from route 119, now a boss in the Weather Institute. Requires at least one Weather Institute clear so that players will always have to defeat Aqua Admin Shelly at least once.

The other Castform forms remain on 119 but now require owning base Castform in addition to the weather requirement.

Removed fog from the possible weathers for Castform (snowy). Don't know why that was there.

Additionally a small bug fix, added Weather Institute to the requirements for route 120.

* Some questline fixups (#5)

Added grunt 103 to the list of eligible grunts for the quest.
Changed the QuestLineStepCompletedRequirement to quest 0. rainbowInvasion is the first quest in the chain, this makes it quest 0, GameConstants.AchievementOption.less means this quest is NOT cleared, so the requirement is ""the first quest in the chain is not cleared"", whereas before it was ""the second quest in the chain is not cleared"".

* Rainbow Rocket for Aether Foundation (#6)

Fully Rainbow Rocketify the Aether Foundation.

A new fancy overlay becomes active during the Defeat Rainbow Rocket questline. Intentionally placed above all of the other Aether Foundation SVG so that that stuff is still laid on top of this overlay.
Also moved all the Rainbow Rocket temporarybattles to the Aether Foundation building.

Also features a fix to QuestLineHelper.ts to make the game actually load, a fix to the Rainbow Leaders requirements so that they activate at the right time, and a typofix on one grunt's returntown.

* QuestLineHelper Cleanup

Create some order in the unorganized chaos of QuestLineHelper.ts. Will definitely be useful in future when we potentially get many more questlines for obtaining legendaries and alternate forms and such stuff.

QuestLines are now ordered by region, within regions they are ordered by when they would be obtained, and there's a bonus ""Event"" category at the bottom.

* Spaces and Vivillon is Kalos

Moved 218 in the file and changed its difficulty to match the moment it unlocks. It shouldn't be harder than 216 and 217.

Removed Noctowl boss from Lake Valor, since it doesn't exist there in Platinum version. Replaced with Bibarel. Yay, Bibarel gets to be a boss somewhere, I'm so proud.

The notification sounds all played at the same volume percentage, but
had different peak gains in the mp3 files. I've run them through
`mp3gain -r -k` to balance them against each other and to avoid
clipping. They all appear to be about equal, however they may be
slightly quieter than desired due to avoiding clipping on some tracks.

* Department stores

I put the Kalos department store in Lumiose because that city is basically one giant department store.

* Everything else oops

Undergrounds:
Johto near Alph.
Hoenn in the desert, it has ruins in Emerald.
Sinnoh near Solaceon
Unova in the desert, might move it closer to Relic Castle.
Kalos near Geosenge, oldest place in the region.

Farms:
Johto route 38, the largest collection of berry bushes in a small area.
Hoenn route 123, berry master's house and garden.
Sinnoh just randomly on route 212.
Unvoa route 20 near Floccesy Ranch, closest thing to a farm I could think of.
Kalos route 7 because there is a location literally called Berry Fields.

Daycares in all the places they appear in the games.
Johto route 34
Hoenn route 117
Sinnoh Solaceon
Unova route 3
Kalos route 7

* Repaired Plasma Frigate

* Create unique Celadon department store with more limited inventory

* Remove LilyCoveCityShop

* Removed VeilstoneCityShop and OpelucidCityShop

* Removed Great Ball from LumioseCityShop and removed GoldenrodCityShop, moved its items to other places

Soothe Bell to Ecruteak because of its giant bell tower.
Upgrade to Mahogany and Sunstone to Cianwood for no real reason.

* Created unique Goldenrod department store without Large Restore, as that first shows up in Blackthorne

* Removed RoyalAvenueShop

* Removed LumioseCityShop entirely

Kalos adds nothing to the electric egg anyway

* Moved Sinnoh farm to route 214

* Moved Kalos underground over a bit

To make room for Team Flare HQ as a separate dungeon. Maybe possibly at some point. Since that thing seems to confuse people.

* Dungeon Loot Changes

This pull request either changes or removes excess loot from dungeons.  A lot of the changes were removing earlier versions of the same item (Medium Restores when Large Restores were present), and removing Restores from the later dungeons (Alola/Galar) due to the fact that players who have reached this point should have no problem affording them.

This also removes some of the excess Underground items from some of the dungeons.

This should lay the groundwork for more changes down the road.

Made the text of the Surprise Togepi Quest Line a bit better. Removed the ferry part about Johto and mentioned the forest, since people were having issues with that step. Also made the third one less explicit since it was the only one that named the dungeon.

I still feel this quest needs to change further but like this it's, at least, a bit more clearer for the player where they need to go in the Johto step.

Currently, if y is 10 and reward.space.length is 2 (i.e. we're on the second to last row and the item is two spaces high), then the item is placeable, but current comparison is '>= 12' so the method returns false. Using strict comparison fixes this issue.

Additionally, Mine.getRandomCoord also never returns the last row/column, adding one to the call fixes that.

Berries are using the new growth system
