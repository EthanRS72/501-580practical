There's a mempool optimization in IBC where a tx doesn't enter the block if one of the messages failed in the mempool (yeah they execute the messages). On Secret if a message goes to CosmWasm, we verify the input against the signed bytes and against the signed block commit. The issue was that it couldn't find an IBC ack message in the signed block. Turned out to be a simulation in the mempool so there isn't a signed block at this point.

Import cosmwasm-std as cosmwasm-v010-std,

For reference, wasmi-runtime is also oblivious to the
v0.10->v0.16 upgrade, but because it's compiled as an
enclave we copy the specific types needed from
cosmwasm-std into wasmi-runtime.  So to do the

This commit replaces `ioutil.TempDir` with `t.TempDir` in tests. The
directory created by `t.TempDir` is automatically removed when the test
and all its subtests complete.

Prior to this commit, temporary directory created using `ioutil.TempDir`
needs to be removed manually by calling `os.RemoveAll`, which is omitted
in some tests. The error handling boilerplate e.g.
	defer func() {
		if err := os.RemoveAll(dir); err != nil {
			t.Fatal(err)
		}
	}
is also tedious, but `t.TempDir` handles this for us nicely.

Set sanity test log level to error so it doesn't spam

* Bumped up go-cosmwasm rust version

* Fixed secretjs - added proto decoding for the data, and some more compatability fixes.

Changed registration queries to make a little more sense (breaking change, but it's aight)

* Update sanity-test.sh

* Update callback-test.sh

* Fixed decrypting data field (had to add base64 encoding)
Reverted returned type to Uint8array (Even though types don't match up)
