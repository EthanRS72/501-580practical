- The ID from the above is then passed to the Retweet API call.
- Rate limits should be ok, the call to pull retweets can only pull 20 at a time.

**gameWispHandler.js**
- Fixed bugs in getting back data from GameWisp.

**java_websocket.jar**
- Updated to new version.

**dashboardPanel.js**
- Fixed infinite query loop issue.

**hostraidPanel.js**
- Fixed issue with updating panel.

**pointsPanel.js**
- Fixed issue with updating panel.

**viewersPanel.js**
- Fixed issue with updating panel.

Since the ""user-type"" tag in deprecated and Twitch wants us to reply on badges, a user can sometimes lose its badge for no reason from one message to another. So, this could possibly make the bot lose its moderator powers, even though the bot is still a mod, so checking the ""mod"" tag before removing a user's moderator permissions is the only way to fix this, an admin or staff member could lose moderation powers from the bot for a second if they are not a channel moderator, so the bot would try and time them out if a moderation filter is triggered. This fix is only to prevent the bot from losing moderator powers.",0,51,0,1

There are restrictions on this due to the Twitch API.  Twitch allows us to poll the
clips from the ""day"" (assuming this is the current day, not sure if it is last 24 hours
or not though).  We poll 100 of the clips.  We then scan over all of the clips for the
newest one.  If this is newer than the last one in the database, then an event will be
sent and a message presented in chat.

Keep in mind that if you have over 100 clips in the ""day"" period, that the newest one
will only bubble up if it has more views than the last newest clip.  This, unfortunately,
is what Twitch returns and we hope they provide a better endpoint in the future.

This endpoint will be polled every 60 seconds.

- Handles the event from Twitch and displays a message in chat
- Supports !clipstoggle and !clipsmessage
- !clipsmessage supports (name) and (url) tag

Removing the initReady hook in init.js as it is not loaded via loadScriptR API which sets the $script object used by the addHook object.  Now, the registerChatCommand() calls for chat, module and reconnect still function and are loaded:

[02-05-2016 @ 20:17:15] Bot locked & loaded!

Summary:
Fix Keyword panel not reflect modified cooldown.

To Reproduce:
- Add a new keyword.
- Edit keyword cooldown
- Check the keyword cooldown

Explanation:
Back in Ver 2.4.0.2, it was using cooldowns[keywords] to access the cooldown for each keyword.
In Ver 2.4.0.3, ```function editKeywordnew(keyword, response)``` has been changed to ```function editKeywordnew(idx)```.
keywords, responses, isRegexs array are all using index to locate the records. cooldowns array is the only one left still using keyword to locate the records.

This fix will solve this issue.",0,26,0,0

- scripts/systems/customCommands.js
	- Supports customapi again
	- !addcom (customapi url)
	- This will dump what is read in from a URL to chat.  Users should take caution to review what would come in first.
	- Added new support for customapijson
	- !addcom (customapijson key url)
	- !addcom (customapijson object.key url)
	- !addcom (customapijson object.object...key url)
	- This will perform a simple parse on a JSON object that is returned from a web API. The 'key' is the data to present to the user from the JSON object.  By default, the top level JSON object shall be parsed.
	- The user may choose to dig into a lower level JSON object
	- JSON ARRAYS are NOT supported at this time!  Need to figure out an easy syntax for the user to support instructing the parser as to what is an object and an array.
- scripts/init.js
	- FIX for ranks; stop loading the core/ranks.js (which should be removed)
- scripts/lang/english/systems/systems-ranksSystem.js
	- FIX for ranks; minor updates to lang file.",0,1,0,1

Add points based on donation - but I would like a calculation from the team for that. Always 1:1? Allow the user to configure X points to 1 dollar? X points to Y dollars configurable?

Presently has !lastdonation -- do we want to shoot for !lastdonation for last 5 donations? Configurable?

Right now I am generating a key for ""IllusionaryBot"" from www.illusionaryone.com/iobotauth This is fine, but, I am going to assume that the team should host from phantombot.net and register their own application with TwitchAlerts (I can help with this).

This is a commit of all of the changes needed to support emote handling, however, in PhantomBot.java, the loading of the cache, which enables the code, has been disabled (commented out) as more testing is needed.  However, I wanted to check this in so that it was in the source repo for now. If someone does wish to enable this to test it:

1) Modify source/me/mast3rplan/phantombot/PhantomBot.java
- Uncomment this line: //this.emotesCache = EmotesCache.instance(this.channel.getName().toLowerCase());

2) Place this function call in chatModerator::$.bind('ircChannelMessage'): $.patternDetector.getNumberOfEmotes(event);

This still won't do much, I am testing this with test messages right now and still need to add in the limits and limit edit functionality. My primary concerns are speed, stability, and speed.  If you want to see it ""doing something"" then you need to uncomment log messages in patternDetector::getNumberOfEmotes.",0,1,0,1

one event with all joins and parts and new users list to a new event
called `IrcChannelUsersUpdate` every 10 minutes which will run on a new
thread in Rhino to update the lists. This can take 3 minutes to run with
36,000 viewers but doesn't slow down events like the old method did. The
old method would queue all events which would cause the bot to slow
down.
