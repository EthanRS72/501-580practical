The problem was connected with incorrect keys for functionalGroup
After we click on undo action or press Ctrl+z
functionalGroups and sgroups maps has different id's in maps
You can check it by using ketcher.editor.struct() in console.
Seems different id's for sgroup and functionalGroup breaks undo() sometimes.
Previously id's for sgroup and functionalGroups were the same

To solve the problem I took key instead of id inside functionalGroup map

- created findKeyOfRelatedGroupId that delivers correct id for functionalGroup
- created getters struct / functionalGroup and other to not create same constants everytime
- refactored code

* Change Calculation of the position for InfoPanel component. For template structure calculation do not change at all.
For now it calculates according to the green rectangle that appears when user hovering over the element.
Function calculateMiddleCoordsForRect calculate middle coord for each side of the rect.
After that panel appears relativly to the middle point of side.

- created WrapperPositionedRelativeToRectangle component.
- moved calculateScrollOffsetX , calculateScrollOffsetY into helpers.ts to reduce code duplication
- created calculateMiddleCoordsForRect accepts array of arrays [[1,2], [3,4], [3,4]] => [{ x: 2, y: 3 }, { x: 3, y: 4}]
- added wrapperRef on div to get dinamically changed width / height of the element

* - fixed issue with selection tool

* - fixed eslint error

* - fixed comments
