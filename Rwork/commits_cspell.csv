This feature improves the suggestions shown by the spell checker.

It allows dictionary authors to specify character sequences that should be considered similar.

When defining a dictionary it is now possible rank certain suggestions higher or lower by adding edit costs to the new section `dictionaryInformation`.


* refactor and adjust suggestion weights
* pull pipe library into trie lib for now
   - At some point this will get split out into its own library, but for now it is useful to have in trie-lib.
* refactor `mapDictionaryInfo`
* Make pipe coverage 100%
* Add initial pass at alphabet and accents
* refactor: rename pipe operators
* refactor mapDictionaryInfo
* Support `v is T` on filters.
* Reduce duplicate code
* Make progress with accent replacement.
* Add default support for accents.
* Create WeightMap when a dictionary is created.
* Increase the default cost
   - Make sure letters not in the alphabet are more expensive.
* Update api.d.ts",17,60,1

- Pinned actions by SHA https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/blob/main/docs/checks.md#pinned-dependencies

>Pin actions to a full length commit SHA

>Pinning an action to a full length commit SHA is currently the only way to use an action as an immutable release. Pinning to a particular SHA helps mitigate the risk of a bad actor adding a backdoor to the action's repository, as they would need to generate a SHA-1 collision for a valid Git object payload.

https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-guides/security-hardening-for-github-actions#using-third-party-actions

[How do I validate these pinned actions?](https://gist.github.com/naveensrinivasan/ca008c07279176acce28969fb77d056f)

Also, dependabot supports upgrading based on SHA. https://github.com/ossf/scorecard/pull/1700

GitHub's own repository pin's their checkout actions by SHA and doesn't use the version tag

# Add support for cache options in config files

A new config section has been added, `cache`.

As a rule, any options specified on the command line override options in the configuration files.

## `cspell.json`

```ts
{
    cache?: CacheSettings;
}
```

## CacheSettings:

```ts
{
    /**
     * Store the results of processed files in order to only operate on the changed ones.
     * @default false
     */
    useCache?: boolean;

    // cspell:word cspellcache
    /**
     * Path to the cache location. Can be a file or a directory.
     * If none specified `.cspellcache` will be used.
     * Relative paths are relative to the config file in which

    cacheLocation?: FSPathResolvable;

    /**
     * Strategy to use for detecting changed files, default: metadata
     * @default 'metadata'
     */
    cacheStrategy?: CacheStrategy;
}
```

## New CLI Option `--no-cache`

- `--no-cache` ensures that the cache is not used even if `cspell.json` has caching enabled.

## Misc
* Improve testing of cache options in application.
* Add cli option `--no-cache`",16,60,1

## Supported Configuration Files

The spell checker will look for the following configuration files.

- `.cspell.json`
- `cspell.json`
- `.cSpell.json`
- `cSpell.json`
- `.vscode/cspell.json`
- `.vscode/cSpell.json`
- `.vscode/.cspell.json`
- `cspell.config.js`
- `cspell.config.cjs`
- `cspell.config.json`
- `cspell.config.yaml`
- `cspell.config.yml`
- `cspell.yaml`
- `cspell.yml`

## Configuration Search

While spell checking files, the spell checker will look for the nearest configuration file in the directory hierarchy.
This allows for folder level configurations to be honored.
It is possible to stop this behavior by adding adding `""noConfigSearch"": true` to the top level configuration.

A Monorepo Example:

```
repo-root
├── cspell.config.json
├─┬ packages
│ ├─┬ package-A
│ │ ├── cspell.json
│ │ ├── README.md
│ │ └── CHANGELOG.md
│ ├─┬ package-B
│ │ ├── README.md
│ │ └── CHANGELOG.md
│ ├─┬ package-C
│ │ ├── cspell.yaml
│ │ ├── README.md
│ │ └── CHANGELOG.md
```

The following command will search the repo start at `repo-root` looking for `.md` files.

```
repo-root % cspell ""**/*.md""
```

The root configuration is used to determine which files to check. Files matching the globs in `ignorePaths` will not be checked. When a file is found, the directory hierarchy is searched looking for the nearest configuration file.

For example:

| File                           | Config Used                      |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `packages/package-A/README.md` | `packages/package-A/cspell.json` |
| `packages/package-A/CONFIG.md` | `packages/package-A/cspell.json` |
| `packages/package-B/README.md` | `cspell.config.json`             |
| `packages/package-C/README.md` | `packages/package-C/cspell.yaml` |
* dev: Add `noConfigSearch` to configuration

Support reading local config files when spell checking a file.

This makes having supporting workspaces with multiple folders easier.

Minor **BREAKING** change.

`cspell` used to ignore all words that had just hex characters `[a-f]`. This lead to issues like #1276. `cspell` will no longer ignore words with only hex characters. To avoid load of false positives (cases where a hex number was intended)
some new patterns were added:
- `CStyleHexValue`: C Style `0x[a-f0-9]+` 
- `CSSHexValue`: CSS Style `#[a-f0-9]+`
- `CommitHash`: GitHub Style commit hashes. - this ignores hex only words that are 7 characters or longer
   might still lead to false negatives.
- `UnicodeRef`: ignores `U+0000` style codes and ranges `U+0000-ffff`
- `UUID`: ignores formatted UUIDs

**Related Changes**
* fix: Remove incorrect Ignore Hex Digits Regexp
  Fix: #1276 
* fix: Ignore commit hashes and C Style Hex numbers
* ci: speed up integration test for AdaDoom
  Do not check machine generated files.

## Making Words Forbidden

There are several ways to mark a word as forbidden:

1. In a custom word list with words beginning with `!`.
    ```
    !forbiddenWord
    ```
2. In `words` section of `cspell` configuration:
    ```
    ""words"": [
        ""!forbiddenWord"",
        ""configstore""
    ],
    ```
3. In `flagWords` section of `cspell` configuration:
    ```
    ""flagWords"": [""forbiddenWord""]
    ```

## Overriding Forbidden words
Sometimes it is necessary to allow a word even if it is forbidden.

### In a comment

```js
/**
 * Do not mark `forbiddenWord` as incorrect.
 * cspell:ignore forbiddenWord
 */
```

### In the `cspell` configuration

```jsonc
{
    ""ignoreWords"": [""forbiddenWord""]
}
```",30,55,1

**Semi-Breaking change**

The updated python dictionary no longer sets `allowCompoundWords` to `true`. If you want the old behavior, add the following to your `cspell.json` file:

**`cspell.json`**
```json
{
    ""languageSettings"": [
        {
            ""languageId"": ""python"",
            ""allowCompoundWords"": true
        }
    ]
}
```

Note: setting `allowCompoundWords` to `true` hides many misspellings.

## Breaking Change starting with 5.3.0

Glob patterns in `ignorePaths` use the same logic as `.gitignore` files.

1. Glob patterns shall be considered relative to the file they are defined in.
1. It is possible to define a `globRoot` to override the default behavior.
   If `globRoot` is `undefined` it will default to the location of the configuration file. `globRoot` can be relative to the file location.
   If a `project/.settings/cspell.json` file has a `globRoot` of `..`, then the `globRoot` will become `project`. To have the root be the current working directory, use `${cwd}`.
1. It is also possible to define a root for each glob pattern.

### Supported Configuration Files

The spell checker will look for the following configuration files.

```javascript
/*
    * Logic of the locations:
    * - Support backward compatibility with the VS Code Spell Checker
    *   the spell checker extension can only write to `.json` files because
    *   it would be too difficult to automatically modify a `.js` or `.cjs` file.
    * - To support `cspell.config.js` in a VS Code environment, have a `cspell.json` import
    *   the `cspell.config.js`.
    */
searchPlaces: [
    // Original locations
    '.cspell.json',
    'cspell.json',
    '.cSpell.json',
    'cSpell.json',
    // Original locations jsonc
    '.cspell.jsonc',
    'cspell.jsonc',
    // Alternate locations
    '.vscode/cspell.json',
    '.vscode/cSpell.json',
    '.vscode/.cspell.json',
    // Standard Locations
    'cspell.config.json',
    'cspell.config.jsonc',
    'cspell.config.yaml',
    'cspell.config.yml',
    'cspell.yaml',
    'cspell.yml',
    // Dynamic config is looked for last
    'cspell.config.js',
    'cspell.config.cjs',
],
```

### Configuration Search

While spell checking files, the spell checker will look for the nearest configuration file in the directory hierarchy.
This allows for folder level configurations to be honored.
It is possible to stop this behavior by adding adding `""noConfigSearch"": true` to the top level configuration.

A Monorepo Example:

```
repo-root
├── cspell.config.json
├─┬ packages
│ ├─┬ package-A
│ │ ├── cspell.json
│ │ ├── README.md
│ │ └── CHANGELOG.md
│ ├─┬ package-B
│ │ ├── README.md
│ │ └── CHANGELOG.md
│ ├─┬ package-C
│ │ ├── cspell.yaml
│ │ ├── README.md
│ │ └── CHANGELOG.md
```

The following command will search the repo start at `repo-root` looking for `.md` files.

```
repo-root % cspell ""**/*.md""
```

The root configuration is used to determine which files to check. Files matching the globs in `ignorePaths` will not be checked. When a file is found, the directory hierarchy is searched looking for the nearest configuration file.

For example:

| File                           | Config Used                      |
| ------------------------------ | -------------------------------- |
| `packages/package-A/README.md` | `packages/package-A/cspell.json` |
| `packages/package-A/CONFIG.md` | `packages/package-A/cspell.json` |
| `packages/package-B/README.md` | `cspell.config.json`             |
| `packages/package-C/README.md` | `packages/package-C/cspell.yaml` |
