* Removed ""unique counter"" and uid adjustment. Uids should be pre-adjusted
in data.

* Renamed ""root_file(s)"" to ""division_file(s)"" as they do in fact point to
division files in the division subfolder. ""root"" is properly a reference
to the collection not the files.

* Set the first entry in a division file to type=""division"", the structure
of the files is such that the first entry is the division entry.

* Update menu query to use division type filter

* Add ""type"" index to ""root"" collection

* Added in logic to detect duplicate uids and spit out error messages
duplicate uids can cause failures later down the line so error seems
to be the appropriate logging level

* Fixes extremely frustrating bug, the query was running before the data
was actually inserted into the database, causing it to do nothing
or worse raise obscure exceptions.

* Remove hack to set division type: it should be set correctly in the data files
remove debugging message.

* Simplify submenu query",1,8,0,1,"2017-04-24 21:20:10","233.57"

* Revert ""Revert ""delete redundant header""""

This reverts commit 33fad3b7bb5769c5d335b2489af437ba8ca23086.

* Added model builder. It's not really hooked up to anything right now.
It takes ages (like more than half an hour) to run so easier to just
commit the resulting model.

* [SUCE-627] trial with twitter/fb tags

* [SUCE-627] reducing string lengths

* Added language_id code to identify which language some text probably is.
Because this is bad at distinguishing between say English and French
it is fudged based on the Accept-Language header

* hooked functionality into the query, and fixed bugs in language_id

* adding default cursor to unclickable items

* More bugfixes and some cleanup

* update link to parallels in methodology page (#671)

* Fix parsing of Accept-Language to properly handle country codes
and whitespace

* add fragments

* Polymer.AfterNextRender

* dont preload images

* [SUCE-627] meta data in index

* basic version of PRPL

* improve loading

* Removed script for building language_id model from repo
It will be put into resources repo instead
Reason: Originally before I knew it would take hours to run I though it
could be a part of the automatic data loading process. This doesn't seem
like a good idea anymore.

Instead, use `all_pali_concordance.json`.

Before, the PaliPageNumbinator loaded the contents of `pali_concord.json` into a dictionary that maps a triple—consisting of the Mahasangiti volume code, paragraph number, and the manuscript edition code—to a couple consisting of the book and page number in the PTS manuscripts for the corresponding volume.

After this change, PaliPageNumbinator loads the contents of `all_pali_concordance.json` into a dictionary as before, but the key is a couple, omitting the manuscript edition code which the new loading algorithm will ensure is always a PTS edition. The loading algorithm also handles which PTS edition to use, always preferring the latest one.
