this uses the same dodgy hack used by CraftingTransaction, which assumes that getResultsFor() does not care about the crafting inputs.

While this is currently OK, since none of the currently-implemented recipes care about inputs anyway, it will become a problem when we implement shulker box recipes, so this needs to be addressed.

However, it can't be addressed without BC breaks, so this will have to be dealt with in PM5.

This is a similar refactor to the one I recently did for tiles.

- Entity::createEntity() is removed. In its place are Entity::create() (runtime creation, use where you'd use a constructor, accepts a ::class parameter, throws exceptions on unknown entities) and Entity::createFromData() (internal, used to restore entities from chunks, swallows unknown entities and returns null).
- Entity::registerEntity() is renamed to Entity::register().
- Added Entity::override() to allow overriding factory classes without touching save IDs. This allows more cleanly extending & overriding entities. This method only allows overriding registered Entity classes with children of that class, which makes code using the factory much more sane and allows to provide safety guarantees which make the code less nasty.
- Entity::getKnownEntityTypes() is renamed to Entity::getKnownTypes().
- ProjectileItem::getProjectileEntityType() now returns a ::class constant instead of a stringy ID.
- Cleaned up a bunch of nasty code, particularly in Bow.",65,27,0,1

This may raise a few eyebrows.

Does this mean that all the things that were planned for API 3.0.0 are done?
Not at all. The plans laid out in December 2016 for API 3.0.0 were far too ambitious, and as a result the ALPHA series dragged out forever (18 months now). This is a break away from those plans, to bring development and release flow back to some sort of sanity.

Does this mean that my plugins will stop breaking all the time now?
No, it does not! Development isn't going to stop, although breaking changes will be confined only to major API releases. It's anticipated that the major API version will be bumped as nearly as often as the ALPHA version was during the last 18 months. The reason for this return to 3.0.0 is to allow us to fine-tune our release flow so that plugin developers can get advantage of newer, non-breaking API features without having to bump the API in a breaking way.

What are the criteria for the API versions now?
- Major: This will be bumped for breaking changes, changes which will break plugins. it's expected that we'll roll out new major versions regularly.
- Minor: This will be bumped when non-breaking feature additions are made, such that API 3.0.0 plugins would still load on 3.1.0. However, plugins requiring 3.1.0 will not run on 3.0.0.
- Patch: This will be bumped for bugfix updates. Plugins requiring 3.0.0 will work on 3.0.1, but not vice versa.

TL;DR: This insanity has gone on far too long.",45,20,0,1

* Added Liquid->getLiquidLevelDecreasePerBlock()

* Fixed lava turning into cobblestone when flowing over water

* Cache liquid flow vectors for faster entity movement

* Removed a condition that made lava impossible to get rid of
In the PC code, the equivalent code makes the delay between scheduled ticks 4 times longer. Here, it just breaks the code. I don't know what the 4x stuff is about, but this code does not produce the expected behaviour and lava works fine regardless.

* Fixed strange behaviour with liquids trying to flow into other liquids
Liquids should consider other liquids as a path of least resistance. However, they should not actually flow into them. This fixes a variety of CPU leak issues with falling water in large water bodies such as oceans.
This also fixes the plus-shape effect that liquid is supposed to produce when a source is placed above ground.

* Removed a bad optimization making liquids flowing down slopes behave undesirably

* Optimize performance of slope searching by limiting recursion depth based on previous path lengths
If we already found a step down on a previous run after 2 blocks, it doesn't make sense to continue allowing checking 4 blocks because the results will just be ignored. This allows limiting the number of recursion steps, which significantly improves the performance when flowing down slopes.
However, this will still be just as bad for performance on flat terrain as it was to start with.

* Make some Liquid methods only accept Blocks as parameters
these are only ever passed blocks anyway, doesn't make sense to allow vectors.

* Moved some things to local variables
these are each only used in one function, so it doesn't make sense for them to be class members.

* Fixed water flow down slopes going everywhere, but degraded performance again

* Lava should only search 2 blocks for a slope

* Stop wasting CPU calculating optimal flow directions for liquids with too-high decay
It calculates the flow directions and THEN doesn't use them when it
realizes the flow decay is too high. This is completely pointless.

* Use a less hacky method to handle lava flowing into water

* Doubled flow performance on flat terrain
Since calculateFlowCost() usually ends up visiting the same blocks about 6 times when on flat terrain, it makes sense to cache some stuff for when blocks get revisited so expensive dumb checks don't need to keep on being done. On my machine this produces a 50-60% performance improvement when flowing on flat terrain.

* Fixed missing return values in Liquid->onUpdate()
these return values aren't used anywhere, but we should be consistent

* Don't allow flowing back in the same direction we just came from
This reduces the recursions by about 30%, providing about the same percentage performance improvement.

* Remove Liquid's temporalVector (it's not used anymore)
primitive types for the win!

* Move liquid collide to its own method

* add sound for lava/water mix",54,14,0,1

recalculateHeightMapColumn is stateless, so it can't make any assumptions about which subchunks to check for blocks. However, in most the average case (6 allocated subchunks), this causes 2500+ useless SubChunk->getHighestBlockAt() calls (10 per column). Since we're calculating in bulk, we can figure out which subchunks are empty one time and ignore them for all 256 columns.
In the average case, this produced a 50-60% performance improvement for heightmap calculation (~1.1 ms -> 0.5 ms).
In extreme cases where the height is extremely varied, this produces no observable performance benefit, but for most cases with flattish terrain, it's an improvement.
It can likely be further improved, but further performance improvements are outside the scope of this commit and will likely result in more complexity increases.",110,47,0,1

This is the same bug that Entity->getBlocksAround() had, except this actually checks for BB intersections. What this means is that as a result of the bug, one extra layer of blocks is unnecessarily checked on the max sides of the BB.

For example:
Assume you have a BB with maxY -5.5
You're definitely colliding with block -6 (because you're inside it) and you want to check an extra block in case you hit something weird like a fence.
So you want to check _at most_ up to block -5 (inclusive).

Following this maths:
-5.5 + 1 = -4.5
ceil(-4.5) = -4

This causes us to check block -4 unnecessarily. This may be a performance waste - depending on the BB size it could be proportionally a lot of blocks getting unnecessarily checked. This has not been benchmarked.",43,20,0,1

This fixes undefined behaviour when scheduling the same task twice. This is usually accidental and almost never desirable.
Note that this still allows a task to be scheduled again after it has
been cancelled; it only disallows scheduling a task multiple times
concurrently.

This commit will probably break MyPlot and other plugins that have
self-scheduling tasks, but as far as I can tell those use-cases should
be replaced with self-cancelling repeating tasks anyway.",110,45,0,1

In the old days, we used to try to correct this problem by adjusting the region header to match the
length found at the start of the chunk payload. However, this has a very good chance to cause corruption
of other chunks, since we can't do any fast overlap checks (an upsize might cause the chunk's alloocated
area to overlap into another one, causing corruption when either chunk's space gets written to).

This corruption risk has become more problematic since the
introduction of region garbage sector reuse, since a broken location
header could cause chunks to trash each others' saved data.

In addition, if there is a length mismatch, there's a good chance that the oversized chunk itself will
already be corrupted, so we'd just fail trying to decompress it later on.

So, instead of trying to fix this automatically, we bail and hope this doesn't occur often enough for
users to get upset, and allow external offline tools to attempt to repair the mess instead.",104,51,1,1

Re-implement chunk sending, send chunks inside a radius instead of below a count

This sends chunks in concentric squares around players. When the radius is hit, it will pad out the radius until a full circle of chunks is loaded around the player.
TODO: implement radius-per-tick, send chunks in concentric circles, use radius for player spawning.

To set your server chunk radius, change `view-distance` in server.properties. Values are intended to be the same as MCPE render distance values. With matching client and server render distances the chunks should reach the horizon.

NOTE: You may notice significantly increased memory usage per player when increasing these values to something respectable. This is normal and expected.
A player with render distance 14 for example will cause loading of 600+ chunks. A player cannot however exceed the render distance limit set in server.properties - the server will simply not send any more chunks.

Render distance of 8 chunks is approximately 200 chunks. This is roughly equivalent to the original default max-chunks of 192 in pocketmine.yml, but sent in a circle instead of a square.

Wait for client to request a chunk radius before ordering chunks

Use 8 for default maximum radius (roughly matches old setting of 192)

Calculate spawn chunk count from chunk-sending.spawn-radius",43,5,0,1

- Removed MCPE stringy save ID constants from public Tile interface. These are now only used for creating saved tiles from a stored chunk, and saving them.
- Renamed Tile::registerTile() to register()
- Tile::create() and Tile::createFromItem() now accept a class parameter instead of a stringy save ID.
- Tile::create() and Tile::createFromItem() were changed to throw \InvalidArgumentException on unknown/unregistered tile types. They also now never return null, but always (except in exception cases) return an object which is an instanceof the base class specified.",63,27,0,1

Due to the way positions are updated over the network, we only see the end result of a movement and not its preceding actions. In addition, we don't know for sure whether the MCPE collision checks work the same exact way as PM.

TL;DR: It's possible for the client to capture and send a movement frame after they collided with a step and then already moved forward from it some distance, resulting in a weird arc pattern.

This PR checks the range between the old and new positions for collision boxes to ensure that all possible areas are checked for detecting fall damage.

This has been tested and successfully resolves various issues involving running down stairs:
- missing sounds
- random fall damage",63,63,1,1

the footprint of compressed chunk batches is so small now that it doesn't make sense to disable it out of the box. The performance gains from caching chunks are more than worth it.

Moving around a lot will frequently cause the same chunks to get sent several times as it passes in and out of your render distance, and the chunk isn't even changing in that time, so the chunk is getting needlessly re-serialized over and over again.

this particular optimisation became possible thanks to changes in 4.19.

I observed that the allocation of Event objects and calling ->call() was costing us a significant percentage of the time taken in PlayerAuthInputPacket handlers. This change produces a measurable 2 microsecond reduction in overhead for PlayerAuthInputPacket handling when players are not moving (10.7 -> 8.7 microseconds). On a server with 200 players, this translates into a 1% reduction in CPU load for PlayerAuthInputPacket alone. It will also benefit other packets, but not to the extent that PlayerAuthInputPacket benefits.",28,78,1,1

This is a significant breaking change for anything utilizing Tiles as they now do not store their NBT at runtime anymore.
This is another step in the process of ridding PocketMine-MP of runtime NBT.

It can be noticed that all tiles are now using class fields to store properties instead of NBT, which is much faster, uses less memory and is also more concise when written in code.

Highlights:
- Tile->namedtag has been removed.
- Tile->saveNBT() now accepts a CompoundTag() parameter. Typically it's expected that this will be fed a newly-created CompoundTag (this part may be improved in the future).
- New internal methods Tile->readSaveData() and Tile->writeSaveData() have been added. Instead of overriding __construct() and saveNBT() to load and save properties from NBT, you should now implement these methods instead.

This is not final and will see further changes before it's done.",43,20,0,1

this doesn't support editing the rear side of a sign, since the 1.12 format doesn't allow us to represent the rear text, and it would necessitate API breaks to support anyway.

However, we can quite trivially support APIs for the sign GUI, which plugins can use to enable editing signs. PocketMine-MP doesn't currently permit this, since it's currently an experimental feature in 1.20, but plugins can simply use Player->openSignEditor() to mimic it.

This is, however, a byproduct of the fact that APIs needed to be added in order to facilitate the use of OpenSignPacket in 1.19.80.",27,79,1,1

This has been a pain point for a long time due to the misleading nature of the name ""level"". It's also confusing when trying to do things like getting the XP level of the player or such, and also does not translate well to other languages.

This transition was already executed on the UI some time ago (language strings) and now it's time for the same change to occur on the API.

This will burn a lot of plugins, but they'll acclimatize. Despite the scary size of this PR, there isn't actually so many changes to make. Most of this came from renaming `Position->getLevel()` to `Position->getWorld()`, or cosmetic changes like changing variable names or doc comments.",93,31,0,1

This is completely unnecessary and adds extra complexity for no good reason. Maybe it was used historically, but nowadays it is only used to identify players to send async-prepared batch packets to.

There are two alternative ways to do that:
1. use spl_object_hash() as the targets array in CompressBatchedTask
2. use ServerScheduler's object storage to retain references to the Player[] array.

I've opted for the second method.

Removing these identifiers allows great code simplification in removePlayer() and removes the need for those old stupid hacks.

This reverts commit a5418a019dc2a83210084632130db8ce06f529ea.

The more I assessed this, the more I realized that this implementation
doesn't actually offer any value. Since modcounters don't persist after
chunk unload + reload, they can't be reliably used to detect changes in
chunks without additional event subscriptions.
For the purpose I actually intended to use them for (population task
cancellation) there's a) another solution, and b) modcounts are
unreliable for that too, because of the aforementioned potential for
chunks to get unloaded and reloaded.
For the case of detecting dirty chunks within PopulationTask itself,
they are also unnecessary, since the dirty flags are sufficient within
there, since FastChunkSerializer doesn't copy dirty flags.

In conclusion, this was a misbegotten addition with little real value,
but does impact performance in hot paths.",80,61,1,1

this was causing problems with slabs in converted Java worlds, where the
0x8 bit means 'smooth', instead of 'double'. In MCPE it has no effect.

Since Slab doesn't retain the high/low flag for DOUBLE type slabs, this
caused BlockFactory to assume that those states were invalid, and
remapped them to their base state instead.

The following changes resulted in the consistency check:

Remap changed for 43:8 (44:0 (Smooth Stone Slab) -> 43:0 (Smooth Stone Slab))
Remap changed for 43:9 (44:1 (Sandstone Slab) -> 43:1 (Sandstone Slab))

Remap changed for 157:10 (158:2 (Birch Slab) -> 157:2 (Birch Slab))
Remap changed for 157:11 (158:3 (Jungle Slab) -> 157:3 (Jungle Slab))
Remap changed for 157:12 (158:4 (Acacia Slab) -> 157:4 (Acacia Slab))

This was first attempted in f64dc01bd1c14ff3f79bd6c18d0c337dbc0e87e0, but reverted, since I hadn't considered how to handle stripping state data from blocks.

This removes the abusable API RuntimeBlockStateRegistry::fromTypeId() and related methods. These were only used to allow ItemBlocks to magically start referencing other blocks if the blocks were overridden by a plugin, but this was never a well-supported use-case anyway.

Instead of relying on RuntimeBlockStateRegistry, we remember the state that the block had during its constructor, and use that to normalize the non-item properties for asItem().

Farmland can end up scanning up to 162 blocks looking for water in the worst case. This is obviously not great for huge farms where there are thousands of blocks of the stuff.

In most farms, the water won't be moved, and nor will the farmland. This means that we can avoid this costly search on random updates.

This PR implements a cache using blockstate data (only possible in PM5) which stores an index mapping to a coordinate offset where water was previously found by this farmland block. This allows the farmland to avoid water searching entirely in most cases.

This is a colossal improvement as compared to scanning the whole 9x2x9 area every time, which, on average, scans about 40 blocks to find water if the water is at the same Y coordinate. In real terms this translates into about a 8x performance improvement for farmland (see timings below).",4,85,1,1

These two factors combined, along with the fact that blocklight and skylight arrays are usually all-zeros, allow us to produce a significant memory usage reduction of loaded chunks.

Now, that problem is gone, so it doesn't matter as much if there are permission bugs which cause commands to be erroneously missing.

Warning for plugin developers: This is a silent BC break. It won't raise any errors.

This alters the default behaviour of event handlers to **not** receive cancelled events by default.
It is now required to opt into receiving cancelled events by using the @handleCancelled directive (or the handleCancelled parameter where it's appropriate).

The ambiguous @ignoreCancelled directive is now ignored.

Ramifications:
- The majority of handlers with `if($event->isCancelled()) return;` no longer need such checks.
- Handlers with `@ignoreCancelled true` or `@ignoreCancelled` annotations can have them removed.
- Handlers which want to receive cancelled events need to use `@handleCancelled`.",94,32,0,1

Since light population is required to make a chunk tickable, a chunk may not be tickable for some time if the async workers get backlogged.
The previous version of this system only cached the eligibility result if the result was a ""yes"", but we can also track it when it's a ""no"", rather than rechecking it every tick.

This change should improve performance in factions and similar gamemodes, which involve large maps with sparsely distributed players, where each player likely has an independent, non-overlapping ticking chunk circle.

We also ditch TickingChunkEntry in favour of multiple arrays to track the eligibility states. This allows us to avoid rechecking the (even cached) readiness of potentially thousands of chunks. If there are no ticking chunks to recheck, this reduces the cost of the selection process to zero.",28,79,1,1

getName() essentially serves as an ID for the command for CommandExecutors. It has no other sane use case.

Since it's not unique (multiple commands with the same name may be registered, and the fallback alias will be used on conflict), it cannot be used for array indexing. It's also not correct to use it for any display purpose, since the command may not be able to be invoked by its 'name' if there was a conflict.

There is an open debate about what to do with getName() and the wider CommandExecutor ecosystem, but that's a topic for another discussion.

* Enchantment: Split enchantment type data from instance data
This commit splits enchantments into (effectively) enchantment TYPES vs enchantment INSTANCES.

When applying an enchantment to an item, it only needs to know 2 things:
1. the enchantment ID (identifier) which is used to identify the TYPE
2. the enchantment LEVEL which is used to modify the enchantment's power IN THIS INSTANCE.

Therefore, the LEVEL is not an immutable property. However, all other properties of the currently-named ""Enchantment"" class are immutable type properties.
Currently, when applying an enchantment to an item, a copy of the enchantment object is created from the registry, and returned. This copies all of the properties contained by the type, which is obviously sub optimal.",55,15,0,1

Previously to this, a level would be considered ""not generated"" if no level providers registered as valid for that directory.

Track which direction the current node's light came from, and don't

e.g. if this node was the eastern neighbour of a light source, we don't
need to check this node's western neighbour, as we already know it has
a higher light level than our own.

This improves performance of basic light spread in a void by about 6%,
which isn't a huge amount, but it's something.

This is basically how blockstate discovery would actually work in the full-blown system. This maps blocks with unrecognized blockstates to static runtimeIDs not known to the client.

This means that all blocks which don't have corresponding runtimeIDs in the new system will translate to update! blocks instead.

Mojang do this differently: they try to a) match id+meta, if that fails b) match id+0, and if that fails, then replace with update! block runtime ID. I can't do that here because I need to be able to convert both ways. They only need to be able to convert from legacy -> new.",57,17,0,1

This commit contains quite a few breaking changes with respect to how AsyncTasks are handled. This is necessary to allow separation of the ServerScheduler and the AsyncPool, because in the future the ServerScheduler may be removed and instead there will be isolated per-plugin sync-task schedulers - but we cannot have every plugin with its own worker pool for memory usage reasons if nothing else.

The following things have changed:
- ServerScheduler: scheduleAsyncTask(), scheduleAsyncTaskToWorker(), getAsyncTaskPoolSize(), increaseAsyncTaskPoolSize() and similar methods have all been removed. Additionally the static \$WORKERS field has been removed.
- Server: added API method getAsyncPool(). This grants you direct access to the server's AsyncPool. Calls to getScheduler()->scheduleAsyncTask() and scheduleAsyncTaskToWorker() should be replaced with getAsyncPool()->submitTask() and submitTaskToWorker() respectively.",42,20,0,1

This API is much more flexible than the old, allowing any arbitrary set of chunks to be ticked.

These changes also improve the performance of random chunk ticking by almost entirely eliminating the cost of chunk selection. Ticking chunks are now reevaluated when a player moves, instead of every tick.

The system also does not attempt to check the same chunks twice, leading to further improvements.

Overall, the overhead of random chunk selection is reduced anywhere from 80-96%. In practice, this can offer a 5-10% performance gain for servers with sparsely distributed players.",31,78,1,1

This change was made after exploring turning this into a permission. It occurred to me that this feature is entirely superfluous because it's non-vanilla, can be done by plugins, and is usually considered as a bug. In addition, disabling this behaviour required third party code just for this one thing because it was not able to be managed by a permissions plugin.
Instead, it's better to produce a plugin which implements this behaviour if it's desired, by making use of SignChangeEvent and PlayerChatEvent/PlayerCommandPreprocessEvent.

It is somewhat reasonable to have a function in an event handler which accepts an Event parameter, but is not a handler. For example, multiple event handlers can redirect to the same function to process an event, but this function may not want to receive called events.

There are other ways to get around this, such as making the event handler protected/private, or adding a dummy parameter, but this way is cleaner and more explicit.

In past versions we couldn't lazily initialize it, because the object might get destroyed before the main thread had a chance to dereference it, leading to a crash when collecting completed tasks. This is no longer an issue thanks to object rescue behaviour implemented in pthreads 5.1.

this is mostly working, but due to some issue with leaf decay, the edges of the larger canopy will decay within minutes.

I don't know why this is yet, but it's likely some incorrect implementation of Leaves causing the problem.

In addition, the secondary branch of acacia may generate next to the base block of the trunk, which I've never observed to happen in vanilla. This has a 2% chance of occurring, so I haven't been able to rule it out yet, but it probably shouldn't happen.",18,80,1,1

However, this kind of internal ID reuse makes no sense in PM5, since said IDs are only used in the core itself at runtime to identify types and states.

Even if we were to allow overriding block deserializers, overriding serializers makes no sense whatsoever, since the original block would continue to exist and be accessible.

this is pretty much always going to cause unexpected behaviour, as most execute() implementations don't expect empty strings, and it can also pad the args with dummy entries, breaking argument count requirements (e.g. aliasing say  and using the alias with no arguments will confuse the target command).

Instead:
- Drop arguments that cannot be resolved (leave them unspecified)
- If they are at the end of the argument sequence, this is OK - it will behave the same as if some optional arguments weren't specified.
- If they are in the middle of the argument sequence, this will generate an error - this is preferable to having the target invoked with an empty string, which might cause unexpected behaviour.

This required the following:
- A generation task (taskA) to already be running for any chunk (chunkA)
- A chunk (chunkB) is requested for generation, and the task (taskB) to do the generation
  is commenced immediately
- chunkB generation promise is aborted (e.g. due to chunk unload) and
  taskB is orphaned
- chunkB is subsequently re-requested, but ends up in the generation
  queue because taskB is still running
- taskA completes and drains the generation queue
- chunkB attempts to be populated a second time, but taskB has not yet
  been collected, resulting in an assertion failure.

this was an interesting bug.

This was discovered by making a projectile's drag 0, making its gravity a factor of its throw force (such that force / gravity = integer value), and then throwing it directly up. At the apex, an error would occur due to trying to do a ray trace with a zero vector.

This also led me to realize that there's an edge case in the current movement system - if an entity's motion reaches 0, it will stop getting movement updates. This can be undesirable when things such as gravity cause motion to become zero when throwing a projectile directly upwards. This will need to be fixed separately.",49,21,0,1

The rationale here is that inventories don't actually pick items up - their holders do.
It's especially misleading to say that an inventory is picking up an item in creative mode when the picked-up item can't actually be added to the target inventory in the first place.

This change allows a range of new functionality, such as:
- Allowing survival players to pick items up even when their inventories are full, similarly to creative players
- Changing the destination inventory of collected items (e.g. items could be redirected to the offhand or ender chest inventory, while still allowing other plugins to understand what's happening)

As an added bonus, this obsoletes one more use case for Inventory->getHolder(), bringing us one step closer to removing the cyclic reference nightmare from inventories.

The choice of naming (EntityItemPickup, instead of EntityPickupItem) is to be consistent with other events, where the word order is SubjectObjectActionEvent.",86,59,1,0

Previously, we were using codegen to support describing a fixed set of enums.

Instead, we implement an enum() function, allowing any native PHP enum to be described.
All enums used in runtime data have been migrated to native PHP 8.1 enums in minor-next to facilitate this.

This implementation:

- is faster (in extreme cases by 40x, such as with PotionType)
- requires way less code
- does not require a build step
- is way more flexible

This fixes #5877, increasing the range of stuff that plugins are now able to do.

EnumTrait enums are not supported, as it's easier and cleaner to just support native enums. Most core EnumTrait enums have been migrated to native enums by now to facilitate this.",4,83,1,1

The basic principle here is ""if you're not expecting it, don't catch it"".

Event handlers are **never** supposed to throw exceptions. If they do throw exceptions, it's usually going to one of two things;
1. Broken code producing an error
2. Code triggering (and not catching) a runtime error

Both 1) and 2) boil down to defective code on the part of the event handler, and thus should not be caught by the caller, but instead allowed to crash the server and produce a crashdump.

It's also undesirable to catch unexpected errors here for a few other reasons
- It leaves the owner of the event handler in an unknown, potentially unstable state
- It allows broken code to cause event handlers to spam the logger in events that happen frequently (for example movement handlers)
- It allows the process to continue down a train of further undefined behaviour, which may lead to more errors or ultimately a crash, so it makes no sense to hold off the inevitable.

This has a few advantages that are not merely inverted disadvantages:
- Crash dumps will now be created and automatically submitted for defective event handlers, allowing quicker issue location, debugging and fixing in plugins without manual user interaction
- Event calling now isn't dependent on Server to work.",52,24,0,1

When profiling this, I noticed that we spend a stupidly large amount of time creating useless Position objects in the case of update=true, because Vector3->sides() calls Position->getSide(), which calls Position::fromObject(parent::getSide()). This is stupid because the update logic doesn't require Positions anywhere (as evidenced by this change needing no other alterations.

A rough profile shows that this improves setBlock() performance by about 25% in the update=true case, which is a pretty big margin.
As an added bonus, it gets rid of some unrealized cyclic dependencies in World->changedBlocks.",63,61,1,1

since most blocks have no state data, their lower 8 bits of state data were all zero.
This makes state IDs a bit more distributed for minimal cost.

I considered flipping these around and using type ID in the lower bits directly, but this worsened distribution for walls.

In the worst case, largest number of collisions drops from 11 to 5 with this change, and the number of states with unique hash keys increased from 3518 to 4461 (out of 7638). This is still a long way from perfect, but it's a decent improvement, improving the overall load factor from 1.6 to 1.3.

- Removed `Server->getScheduler()`. All plugins now have their own scheduler which is accessible using `Plugin->getScheduler()`. Aside from being syntactically more concise and pleasant, this also allows much more effective management of tasks when plugins are disabled.
- Removed `PluginTask` class. Before this PR it was necessary for plugin tasks to descend from `PluginTask` to ensure that the server could clean them up correctly on plugin disable. This is no longer necessary, so the `PluginTask` class has been removed. Plugins may now utilize the `Task` class as a base if they like.
- Added `Server->getAsyncPool()`. Since the global scheduler does not exist any more, it does not manage the server's `AsyncPool` any more. Additionally, `ServerScheduler` was previously bloated by a lot of `AsyncTask` related methods, which are now not necessary because direct access to `AsyncPool` is granted instead.

- `ServerScheduler`:
  - `ServerScheduler` has been renamed to `TaskScheduler` since it is now a general-purpose task scheduler which is non-dependent on the user. This allows much greater flexibility and also makes it possible to unit-test.
  - All `AsyncTask`/`AsyncPool` related methods have been removed - the task scheduler does not manage the async pool anymore.
    - Calls to `Server->getScheduler()->scheduleAsyncTask()` should be replaced with `Server->getAsyncPool()->submitTask()`.
    - Calls to `Server->getScheduler()->scheduleAsyncTaskToWorker()` should be replaced with and `Server->getAsyncPool()->submitTaskToWorker()`.

## Backwards compatibility
This poses significant backwards compatibility breaks for any plugins utilizing Tasks or AsyncTasks. These breaks are described above, along with basic upgrade steps. The upgrade process is quite straightforward.

## Follow-up
A large part of the goal with this pull request is to modularize these parts of the code so that they can be reused and also unit-tested. I would like to remove the existing test set from TesterPlugin at some stage when the AsyncPool can operate without a Server.

Because of the above, I am considering making further backwards incompatible changes directly to `AsyncTask` to remove the `Server` parameters from `onCompletion()` and `onProgressUpdate()`. These shouldn't be too difficult to upgrade from and can be prepared for in advance.",43,20,0,1

in vanilla, it appears to behave as if the player always clicked on the up face if a block was replaced.

In PM, we were still using the original face, which caused bugs when, for example, placing a button next to a wall by clicking on the side of tallgrass. The button would replace the tallgrass, but stick to the wall, instead of placing itself on the ground like vanilla expects.

This may appear unusual to anyone who also happens to implement canBePlacedAt(), since the facing behaviour will be different. However, this behaviour appears to match vanilla, and even slabs (which I feared might break because of this change) work perfectly.

In the future, it may be desirable to pass some other value here, such as null, to indicate that the clicked block is being replaced. However, that's a BC break and therefore outside of the scope of a stable bug fix.",43,75,1,1

Introduction
This PR is a second attempt at improving movement processing to fix #1215 , #2730 and more.

This is significantly less complex than the previous attempt #2646 -- it gets rid of the movement buffering system entirely and instead relies on a simple rate limit counter to restrict on-the-fly movement processing.

Movement is rate limited to a max average of 2 per tick. It allows up to 5 seconds' backlog to accommodate network lag. The rate limit counter is increased by 2 per tick and decreased once for every movement processed. This prevents movement processing being abused for denial of service attacks.

Changes
API changes
This PR, while obviously highly beneficial for most current users, poses some BC-breaking issues because of changes to the internal Player API.

Player->processMovement() (protected) has been removed. This is a BC concern for custom player classes which overrode it and called it as a parent. In addition, child implementations won't be called every tick any more, which could break some custom movement processing systems.
Player->newPosition (protected) has been removed. This internal field may have been accessed by custom movement implementations.
Player->isTeleporting (protected) has been removed. BC concern is same as previous point.
Player->getNextPosition() (public) has been @deprecated.
Added the following protected Player class members:
int $moveRateLimit
?Vector3 $forceMoveSync
handleMovement()
processMostRecentMovements()
revertMovement()
Behavioural changes
Player movement is now subject to less rubberbanding and has more reliable behaviour.",114,44,0,1

Bedrock block entity updates don't directly trigger block rendering
updates. This is a problem when the block entity data affects the
block's appearance directly (e.g. cauldron water colour, flower pot
contents), because it means changing them won't directly result in a
client-side render update.

This hack allows tiles to spoof block updates without actually changing
the server-side block, keeping the internals and API clean of random
shitbox workarounds.

This changes the block cache to be a 2-dimensional hashmap of [chunkHash][blockHash]. This is needed to more effectively dispose of chunk-specific block caches when chunks are modified.

This now destroys the cache for specific chunk indexes in the following circumstances:
- When a chunk is unloaded (the cache isn't needed anymore)
- When a chunk is set into the world (for example, from the generator)
- When a chunk is loaded (probably unnecessary)

Since 3.2 there have been some runtime performance issues related to garbage collection and dynamic AsyncWorker booting. This is partly because of GC being dumb about shutting down what it thinks are ""unused"" workers. A worker which has been idle for a single tick is considered the same as a worker which has been idle for hours. The result of this is that on active servers, workers would get shut down and then immediately restarted because of something like chunk sending. Since booting an async worker is frightfully expensive, this causes lag spikes, which is obviously bad.

This commit changes the GC mechanism to only shutdown workers which have not been used for the last 5 minutes.",59,27,0,1

I'm not very clear why this works. PM doesn't use real spectator mode yet (we're still using the faux spectator mode PM has had for years, because I haven't yet assessed how real spectator mode will affect stuff like block interactions), so this ability layer shouldn't have any effect.

On most filesystems, plugins are loaded in lexical order because that's how the filesystem gives the files to us. This is a problem because it can hide bugs with dependency resolution on specific platforms with this behaviour, while inexplicably breaking on other platforms where the load order is different or undefined.

This change prevents plugins depending on any file yield order by randomizing the order in which plugin files are checked for loadability.",96,32,0,1

The result of this is that invalid variants can be much more easily detected, and additionally state handling is much cleaner since meta is only needed at the serialize layer instead of throughout the code.",53,24,0,1

this was achieved by storing binary representations of the blockstates, rather than the original BlockStateData.

Due to the insane object:data ratio of Tag objects (40:1 for ByteTag for example), modestly sized NBT can explode in memory footprint. This has been previously seen with the absurd 25 MB footprint on file load.
Previously, I attempted to mitigate this by deduplicating tag objects, but this was mitigating a symptom rather than addressing the cause.

We don't actually need to keep the NBT around in memory, since we don't actually use it for anything other than matching blockstates. In this case, we can allow the code to be possibly a little slower, since the lookup is anyway slow and the result will be cached.
In fact, using encoded ordered states as hash keys significantly improves the speed of lookups for stuff like walls, which have many thousands of states.

We keep around generateStateData(), since it's still possible we may need the BlockStateData associated, and it can be easily reconstructed from the binary-encoded representation in BlockStateDictionaryEntry.",26,79,1,1

This allows plugins to more easily control the behaviour of server-full, whitelisting and banning. A message can be assigned for each, with a plugin custom reason taking the final priority if set.

This system solves several edge case problems in the Bukkit version by allowing kick reasons to be combined, so that removing one kick reason will roll back the final reason to the next highest, instead of just allowing the player through completely.
Only one message will be shown at point of disconnection, for consistency with the old behaviour.

- Plugin reason
- Server full
- Whitelist enabled
- Player is banned

* World: cache block AABBs directly in the world
this removes some indirection when fetching the AABBs, and also allows the AABB cache to live longer than the block cache.

In local testing this showed a 10-20% performance improvement, but it was difficult to properly measure.

* World: eliminate padding block checks in getCollisionBoxes()
this substantially improves the function's performance for small entities.

The padding of 1 block in each direction was previously necessary to account for blocks like fences, which might have an AABB larger than the cell containing them. However, by tracking this information in the collisionBoxCache directly, we can avoid the need to check this at the expense of slightly more complex code. This reduces the number of blocks checked for a moving item entity from 27-64 all the way down to 1-8, which is a major improvement.

Locally, this change allowed me to simulate 2100 item entities without lag, compared with 1500 on the previous commit.",4,82,1,1

This features a near-total rewrite of PluginLoaders and some code associated with them.

Highlights:
- PluginManager->registerInterface() does not return anything, and now accepts a PluginLoader instance instead of a string.
- PluginLoader itself is drastically simplified. getPluginFilters(), enablePlugin() and disablePlugin() are now removed. loadPlugin() responsibilities are now solely confined to doing whatever is necessary to make the plugin's classes visible by the server, and does not emit log messages or check for data directories.
- PluginBase->init() and PluginBase->isInitialized() have been removed.
- Plugin interface now declares a signature for the constructor which implementations must comply with.
- Plugin interface now declares setEnabled().",45,20,0,1

Given the various limitations and flexibilities posed by EntityItemPickupEvent, I settled on this as the simplest way to deal with the problem.

- EntityItemPickupEvent may have its destination inventory changed, so we can't cache the result of getAddableItemQuantity() to use after the event.
- The item itself may have changed, so even if we thought we could add some items before the change, we might not be able to afterwards.

Considering the above facts, it's better to just give the whole itemstack to EntityItemPickupEvent, and let plugins use getAddableItemQuantity() on their own to decide if their chosen inventory can accommodate the item or not.
If it can't, then we'll just drop it on the ground.
This also fixes a potential issue where plugins changing the item to a custom one might end up with their items and the actual items both just vanishing if the target inventory was full.

Since task execution depends on tasks executing sequentially on a particular worker in some cases (e.g. PopulationTask must be preceded by GeneratorRegisterTask), it doesn't make sense to continue task execution if an error occurs.
Moreover, a task crashing may render the whole server unstable, as it leaves the server in an undefined state. This is the same kind of problem we fixed with scheduled tasks in PM3.

In versions past, pthreads was unreliable enough that random tasks would crash without an obvious reason, forcing us to accommodate this. I still don't know the origin or frequency of said issues, but I think it's time to rip the band-aid off and solve these problems for real.",19,81,1,1

* Added a new PermissionManager, remove ridiculous cyclic dependencies of Permissions on Server

Aside from all the other ridiculous design problems with the permission system, the biggest problems are its API. This is, once again, a result of poor API design copied from Bukkit.

This pull request removes all permission-related functionality from `PluginManager` and moves it to the `pocketmine\permission\PermissionManager` class.

As can be observed from the removed code in the diff, the permissions system was previously entirely dependent on the Server, because it needed to get the PluginManager for registering permissions. This is utterly ridiculous. This refactor isolates _most_ permission-related functionality within the `permission` namespace.

As mentioned above, this stupid API is a direct result of copying from Bukkit. If you look at the API documentation for Bukkit for `PluginManager` you will see that the methods I'm deprecating here are also in there.

## Changes
- Added a new `PermissionManager` class. This can be accessed via its singleton `getInstance()` static method.
- Deprecated the following `PluginManager` methods - these will be removed no later than 4.0.0:
  - `getPermission()`
  - `addPermission()`
  - `removePermission()`
  - `getDefaultPermissions()`
  - `recalculatePermissionDefaults()`
  - `subscribeToPermission()`
  - `unsubscribeFromPermission()`
  - `getPermissionSubscriptions()`
  - `subscribeToDefaultPerms()`
  - `unsubscribeFromDefaultPerms()`
  - `getDefaultPermSubscriptions()`
  - `getPermissions()`",46,22,0,1

In the future, McRegion and PMAnvil will become deprecated legacy formats which we won't support for writing anymore.

This abstracts away the generic Region-based world functionality into a separate class, making McRegion, Anvil and PMAnvil all inherit from it directly.

fixes #5021 and probably a bunch of other inventory related glitches

When the server initiates a window close, it does so by sending a ContainerClose to the client, which causes the
client to behave as if it initiated the close itself. It responds by sending a ContainerClose back to the server,
which the server is then expected to respond to.

Sending the client a new window before sending this final response creates buggy behaviour on the client, which
is problematic when switching windows. Therefore, we defer sending any new windows until after the client
responds to our window close instruction, so that we can complete the window handshake correctly.

This is a pile of complicated garbage that only exists because Mojang overengineered the process of opening and
closing inventory windows.",62,68,1,1

Previously, upwards movement wouldn't be considered, but downwards would, so if an entity bobbed up and down in the air for a while (e.g. while being comboed in PvP), the downwards distance would accumulate and deal a large amount of fall damage on touchdown.
This commit changes fall distance measurement to correctly account for upwards movement.

A better way of measuring fall distance would simply be to record the highest Y coordinate reached while in the air, and then measure the distance between that and the point of contact when landing.

during unset(), the destructors for other objects with cyclic references can get triggered, resulting in the functions being reentered before the count() call. This leads to a crash because the offset no longer exists.
Instead, we check if only the given PermissibleInternal is present, and clean everything up with a single unset instead of two.
This could also have been solved by adding extra isset() checks before checking the counts, but this way seemed more elegant.

This is similar to an issue with AsyncTask thread-local storage a few months ago, which was also caused by GC reentrancy.

this commit removes the ability to replace centrally registered entity classes in favour of using constructors directly.
In future commits I may introduce a dedicated factory interface which allows an _actual_ factory pattern (e.g. factory->createArrow(world, pos, shooter, isCritical) with proper static analysability) but for now it's peripheral to my intended objective.
The purpose of this change is to facilitate untangling of NBT from entity constructors so that they can be properly created without using NBT at all, and instead use nice APIs.

Spawn eggs now support arbitrary entity creation functions like EntityFactory does, allowing much more flexibility in what can be passed to an entity's constructor (e.g. a Plugin reference can be injected by use()ing it in a closure or via traditional DI.",106,44,0,1

This change breaks pretty much all API pertaining to synchronous task scheduling.

Significant changes:
- Server->getScheduler() has been removed
- Plugin->getScheduler() has been added - every plugin now has its own scheduler
- Because schedulers are now per-plugin, it is now unnecessary for PluginTask to exist because stopping plugin tasks on plugin disable is as simple as destroying the plugin's scheduler. Therefore PluginTask has now been removed and it is expected for things to now use the base Task class instead.

For the most part, plugins will simply need to change Plugin->getServer()->getScheduler()->... to Plugin->getScheduler()->...
Another highlight is that plugin tasks now no longer have global IDs - they are unique to each scheduler.",42,20,0,1

the second time the slot is synced, there is no prediction, so the slot update isn't associated with a request anymore. This causes subsequent requests in the same packet to fail, since the dependency request ID isn't associated with the slot anymore.

This change fixes the problem by only allowing the backing inventory to trigger a call to DelegateInventory->on*Change(). While we could have removed and re-added the listener instead, this way is safer since it doesn't assume that the backing inventory won't modify the given item in setItem().

and doing that would make updating only require one queue instead of two.

This is better for performance because these then don't need to be reevaluated every time they are called.

When encountering an unqualified function or constant reference, PHP will first try to locate a symbol in the current namespace by that name, and then fall back to the global namespace.
This short-circuits the check, which has substantial performance effects in some cases - in particular, ord(), chr() and strlen() show ~1500x faster calls when they are fully qualified.

However, this doesn't mean that PM is getting a massive amount faster. In real world terms, this translates to about 10-15% performance improvement.
But before anyone gets excited, you should know that the CodeOptimizer in the PreProcessor repo has been applying fully-qualified symbol optimizations to Jenkins builds for years, which is one of the reasons why Jenkins builds have better performance than home-built or source installations.
We're choosing to do this for the sake of future SafePHP integration and also to be able to get rid of the buggy CodeOptimizer, so that phar and source are more consistent.",64,27,0,1

this resolves problems with crashes when getName() is called on an unloaded level. This obviously doesn't solve the root cause of the issue (level being accessed after unload) but since many things use the level name without checking if it's unloaded first, it's a bad idea for it to be volatile.

closes #3910

the existing naming was misleading, and many plugin devs assumed that it returns an exact match. However, this is not guaranteed, and it's possible for two different players to match the same prefix.

- There is no defined behaviour for what happens when multiple players can equally match a prefix (e.g. 'fr' could match 'fred' or 'frog' equally, because the name lengths are the same)
- A prefix might match a different player at a different time (e.g. 'fr' could match 'freddie' before 'fred' joins, after which it will match 'fred' instead)

With these flaws in mind, it's better to break compatibility on this to make the intent more clear, and to make plugin developers reassess their usages of this method. In most non-command use cases, they should likely be using getPlayerExact() instead.",105,49,0,1

calculating dynamic states in some cases requires getting properties from neighbouring blocks, but getting these blocks also causes their dynamic states to be calculated, leading to a bouncing recursion.
This change allows retrieving blocks without calculating dynamic state information, if the call was generated by calculating dynamic state information.
Since these blocks are incomplete, they should not be cached and are only used to allow another adjacent block to complete its state. It is therefore not possible for a block's dynamic states to depend on another block's dynamic states.

#5810 was caused by the workaround for #4394, which broke in 1.20 for reasons I'm still unclear on.

As FLAG_TELEPORT does not work at all for non-player entities, and causes bugs with player entities, sending the teleport movement without the flag is the least buggy way to solve all of these issues. Having the client interpolate teleport movements is not ideal, but there doesn't seem to be a way to reliably prevent it without causing even more bugs, so this will have to do.",19,80,1,1

This implements all of the basic activation logic for pressure plates.
It also introduces a PressurePlateUpdateEvent, which is called in pulses when entities are standing on top of the plate and when it deactivates. Deactivation can be detected by checking if the list of activating entities is empty.

I don't care if this matches PC behaviour or not. bugs.mojang.com is full of bug reports about this. Just search for ""minecraft spawn protection not working"" and you'll see what I mean.

If you want to disable spawn protection, actually disable it. This behaviour is something that most users are not aware of and find astonishing when they discover it.

This behaviour was copied from Minecraft PC, and it's nearly as unexpected there as it is here.

Newsflash for readers: the forced authentication is easily bypassed using a LAN proxy.

Un-authenticated LAN connections will still work fine if the online mode is disabled.

This commit fixes the 5+ years-old bug with the movement anti-cheat that everyone has complained about: sprinting on stairs causes rubberbanding.
This commit addresses this problem at long last, along with a handful of precursor commits that were necessary to fix this problem:
- dac76f0e0f14d9beae3e55491ab9f61353db1b68
- 89fe8f7f10716fed6193646984a7e2d28f6f6ce5
- 2d77b1e3649d11a6072fbd1dbf88574b6ebf1af3

Additionally, these changes now allow the anti-cheat to be accurate to at least 0.001 of a block, perhaps even better. I didn't commit a change to the threshold here, but it was instrumental to pinning down the exact nature of these bugs.

This closes #1475, at long last.",113,47,0,1

I was never able to reproduce this, but it appears that Windows breaks the character encoding of command parameters (and also unicode environment variables, even though UNICODE_ENVIRONMENT should be set in php-src) when the file path contains Unicode characters (such as Cyrillic).
We workaround this problem using base64, which is an abysmally shitty hack, but not worse than using a subprocess for ConsoleReader in the first place. PHP fucking sucks, and so does Windows.

This introduces several new session handlers, splitting up session handling into several new states:

- Login: Only allows handling the LoginPacket. This is the only time LoginPacket can be sent, and it'll be discarded when sent at any other time.
- Resource packs: Handles only the resource packs sequence (downloading packs and such). This is the only time ResourcePackClientResponse and ResourcePackChunkRequest will be handled.
- Pre-spawn: Only chunk radius requests are accepted during this state.

SimpleNetworkHandler handles all the ""rest"" of the logic that hasn't yet been separated out into their own dedicated handlers. There's also a NullNetworkHandler which discards all packets while it's active.

This solves a large number of issues with the security of the login sequence. It solves a range of possible DoS attacks and crashes, while also allowing great code simplification and cleanup.",49,22,0,1

this implementation is working, although incomplete:

- The shulker close sound should not be played until the end of the shulker closing animation, which takes approximately 1 second.
- An open shulker box has a different collision box than a closed one - it should be +0.5 in whichever direction the shulker is facing. (During the animation, the bounding box also dynamically changes size - you can see this in vanilla by shooting an arrow into the top of an open shulkerbox facing UP, and then closing it - the arrow will fall and collide with the lid multiple times.

However, resolving both of these issues requires significant internal changes which are beyond the scope of this PR.",80,57,1,0

This reverts commit b172c93e45e60ee3dbfd8a2efbede60b894673a3.

I made a significant mistake with this change: the scaling factor of
batch-by-chunk is O(nSendBytes), while the scaling factor of sending
directly to players is O(nSendBytes * nActivePlayers). It seems like the
real problem is that this system isn't getting enough usage.

While it does reduce compression efficiency in some cases, it falls back
to letting the sessions do individual compression when the amount of
data is less than 256 bytes anyway (compression-threshold in
pocketmine.yml).

My motivation for scrapping this system was to reduce the broadcast
system's complexity to make it easier to thread the living shit out of
compression, but it seems like this change was a step in the wrong
direction for performance.

A few steps can be taken to improve the usefulness of this system (and
also improve output bandwidth):
- Make general entity updates use this system. Movement and velocity
  already kinda used this system, but crucially, players did not,
  because we couldn't prevent the player from receiving its own movement
  updates if we did that, which caused all kinds of problems.
  - Therefore, we need to reintroduce static ""self"" entity IDs, like we
    had in the shoghi days when entity ID 0 referred to the ""self""
    player.
  - However, since entity ID 0 has a variety of interesting bugs since
    it usually refers to ""no entity"" in MCPE, it would be better to use
    1 (or 2, like MiNET does).
  - The fixed ID used should be close to zero to maximize varint
    encoding efficiency.
  - We assumed that changes to player's position and velocity would be
    ignored by the client. This assumption depends on the client and
    could be broken at any time, so it's best not to rely on it.
- Make block updates use this system (when chunk updates are not sent).
  Currently, block updates use a separate mechanism which creates a
  second batch for every active chunk, which wastes CPU, and decreases
  bandwidth efficiency on multiple fronts (reduced compression
  efficiency, more cross-thread interactions, more bytes wasted on
  RakNet packet headers).",115,48,0,1

This commit completely revamps the way that blocks are represented in memory at runtime.

Instead of being represented by legacy Mojang block IDs and metadata, which are dated, limited and unchangeable, we now use custom PM block IDs, which are generated from VanillaBlocks.
This means we have full control of how they are assigned, which opens the doors to finally addressing inconsistencies like glazed terracotta, stripped logs handling, etc.

To represent state, BlockDataReader and BlockDataWriter have been introduced, and are used by blocks with state information to pack said information into a binary form that can be stored on a chunk at runtime.
Conceptually it's pretty similar to legacy metadata, but the actual format shares no resemblance whatsoever to legacy metadata, and is fully controlled by PM.
This means that the 'state data' may change in serialization format at any time, so it should **NOT** be stored on disk or in a config.

In the future, this will be improved using more auto-generated code and attributes, instead of hand-baked decodeState() and encodeState(). For now, this opens the gateway to a significant expansion of features.
It's not ideal, but it's a big step forwards.",56,69,1,1

previously, these were forced to extend BaseInventory because of the amount of crap in Inventory's interface.

This lead to a variety of bugs in the past, such as certain API methods on BaseInventory not working correctly for DoubleChestInventory in particular.

Now, BaseInventory just implements the functional part of the inventory implementation, leaving the storage system up to the implementation.

This is quite an interesting bug. If you have
```php
class A{
    public function onMove(PlayerMoveEvent $event){} //shouldn't be a handler because this class isn't a Listener
}

class B extends A implements Listener{}
```
then
```php
registerEvents(new B, $plugin);
```

then `A::onMove()` will be registered as an event handler even though `A` is not an instanceof `Listener`.

This was observed by noting that plugins which do something like `extends PluginBase implements Listener` causes `registerEvents()` to try and register `PluginBase` methods as event handlers, which could lead to astonishing behaviour.

So this came from a bugfix (795d6c8ddf1148dfe6de8ff5ef38a96aee6124fe) which fixed a memory leak related to entities getting kill()ed on chunk unload.
HOWEVER, me2016 did NOT realize that this code is actually entirely pointless and causes unexpected behaviour.

removeEntity() is used in 2 places in the core code:
1. in Entity->close() (so close() doesn't need to be called again, obviously)
2. in Entity->switchLevel() (which then causes the entirely unexpected behaviour of close()ing the entity on level change.

Conclusion: This code is pointless. This fixes the bugfix.",49,16,0,1

this is a sucky solution but it works well enough for this scenario.

From my research it appears that while the client-side MovementInterpolator is active on the client and hasn't yet reached its target, any teleport sent during the lerp will get overridden by the lerp.
This appears to last 3-4 ticks (about 150-200 ms) which explains why this can be reproduced by stopping movement just before the ender pearl lands (human reaction times would make the reproduction unreliable otherwise).

Things to note:
- All entities are affected by this bug.
- MovePlayerPacket appears not to have the problem, but we can't use it because it doesn't work for non-players.
- MoveActorAbsolute and MoveActorDelta are both handled by the same code and will have the same lerping bug.

This is the cleanest solution I could come up with.",65,66,1,1

WorldProviders now have the following requirements removed:
- __construct() is no longer required to have a specific signature
- static isValid() no longer needs to be implemented (you will still need it for registering, but it can be declared anywhere now)
- static generate() no longer needs to be implemented

This paves the way for more interesting types of world providers that use something other than local disk to store chunks (e.g. a mysql database).

WorldProviderManager no longer accepts class-string<WorldProvider>. Instead, WorldProviderManagerEntry is required, with 2 or 3 callbacks:
- ReadOnlyWorldProviderManager must provide a callback for isValid, and a callback for fromPath
- WritableWorldProviderManagerEntry must provide the same, and also a generate() callback

In practice, this requires zero changes to the WorldProviders themselves, since a WorldProviderManagerEntry can be created like this:
`new WritableWorldProviderManagerEntry(\Closure::fromCallable([LevelDB::class, 'isValid']), fn(string ) => new LevelDB(), \Closure::fromCallable([LevelDB::class, 'generate']))`

This provides identical functionality to before for the provider itself; only registration is changed.",80,57,1,1

zero is not allowed because it's pointless, just raise your compression threshold if you want zero compression.

Chunks will always be compressed regardless of threshold because they are huge. It doesn't make sense to allow uncompressed chunks when even compression level 1 will reduce their size 50x. The point of the last two (reverted) commits was to prevent compression level zero being used on chunks. Probably obvious that I was up late and not thinking very clearly.

while this is slightly less bandwidth efficient (1 in 92 datagrams not full vs 1 in 733), this is significantly less memory-hard.
I made this decision looking at the memory pressures that 1MB chunks exert - especially on RakNet. Client-side, these resource pack chunks all hang around in RakNet memory until the whole thing is received, and it's a lot more costly to receive 733 datagrams than it is to receive 92, especially since it's much more likely that some of the 733 will disappear along the way.
If, for example, the first couple of hundred KB split parts arrived out of 1MB, and then one of the parts got lost, all the already-received parts would hang around in memory not getting processed. With smaller chunks this is much less of a problem.
I explored taking the chunk size all the way down to 1KB to reduce the bandwidth waste caused by split packets (split headers), but this made resource pack downloading unbearably slow, so it wasn't acceptable.",111,44,0,1

* Removed `setCancelled` from `Cancellable`

Before anyone screams, THIS CHANGE WILL NOT AFFECT MOST PLUGINS
(although it allows future changes to break some).

This commit rewrites the documentation of `Cancellable`,
clarifying the concept of ""cancelled"" from the perspective of the event
framework.

This commit also removes the `setCancelled` method from `Cancellable`.
This does not affect plugins using the (originally standard)
`setCancelled` method on events directly, since the implementation on
classes was not removed. On the other hand, it no longer requires
`Cancellable` events to implement this method, allowing flexibility on
cancelation conditions, e.g. subclasses may require additional
parameters for cancellation without needing to use hacks to check that
the user cancelled the event in the correct way.",109,45,0,1

Grouping packets to batch by chunk instead of by player reduces bandwidth efficiency, because the number of active chunks is almost always larger than the number of active players.
With the old mechanism, a batch of packets for each active chunk (which could be dozens, or hundreds... or thousands) would be created once, and then sent to many players. This makes the compression load factor O(nActiveChunks). Broadcasting directly is simpler and changes the load factor to O(nActivePlayers), which usually means a smaller number of larger batches are created, achieving better compression ratios for approximately the same cost (the same amount of data is being compressed, just in a different way).",114,48,0,1

In refactors during PM4, I stripped out packet buffer caching, as it was problematic when events alter packets in undetectable ways.
However, I never cleaned this part of the code up properly after enabling DataPacketSendEvent to include multiple packets and multiple targets, so we were still individually encoding the packet(s) for every single session if the sum total of the sizes was below 256 bytes.

This change encodes packets once in the StandardPacketBroadcaster and retains their buffers to post to the session's send buffer directly if the resulting batch is below compression threshold.

As discussed in #2297:

Honestly I don't see a fit purpose for async saving at all. It should either always be synchronous or always asynchronous, and at the user's own option. However, this isn't currently possible because Config doesn't enable you to get the serialized content without writing it to disk.

Consider the following code:
```php
		for($i = 0, $size = $this->getServer()->getAsyncPool()->getSize(); $i < $size; ++$i){
			$this->getServer()->getAsyncPool()->submitTask(new class extends AsyncTask{
				public function onRun(){
					sleep(5);
				}
			});
		}
		$config = $this->getConfig();
		$config->set(""steve"", ""hi"");
		$config->save(true);
		$config->set(""steve"", ""bye"");
		$config->save(false);
```
Output:
```yml
---
steve: hi
...
```
Expected output:
```yml
---
steve: bye
...
```

Additionally, if your configs are causing you performance issues when you're saving, it's a clear sign that
a) you're saving too much
b) you're abusing configs and should consider using a database.

Configs should be used for _simple_ data which does not change much. Configuration is such that the _user_ is expected to be able to modify it. As such, it should never be an issue to save synchronously.

In the future, something like ReactPHP may be introduced to allow proper async saving. When this happens, async saving would always be sequential but non blocking. Using threads for this makes no sense.",49,21,0,1

When I created this commit, I made the flawed assumption that spawnTo()
would not be used by plugins. In addition, I was not aware that there
are some usages of spawnTo() in the core which do not check for chunk
usage, such as in Player->showPlayer().

This caused a collection of problems including memory leaks and crashes
due to disconnecting players not removing their references from viewed
entities.

This introduces static getters for every currently-known effect type. At some point in the near future, the magic number constants (which are really network IDs, by the way) will disappear.

Migrating:
- If you used constants (like any sensible person would): for the most part it's just a case of adding a () anywhere you used an Effect constant.
- If you hardcoded magic numbers: ... well, have fun fixing your code, and I reserve the right to say ""I told you so"" :)

This achieves multiple goals:
1) creating an EffectInstance for application is much less verbose (see diff for examples, especially the Potion class)
2) plugin devs cannot use magic numbers to apply effects anymore and are forced to use type-safe objects. :)

This is a warning shot for plugin devs who use magic numbers. More changes like this are coming in the not-too-distant future.",78,29,0,1

the following things are changed:
- Player->getSpawn() no longer returns a safe spawn by default. Instead, if the player doesn't have a spawn set, it returns the world's stored spawn directly. This allows consistent behaviour of locating safe respawn positions without double calculation of safe spawn position, and also fixes crash issues during the login sequence if the player's spawn position referred to ungenerated terrain.
- Player->respawn() is now asynchronous, using the promise returned by orderChunkPopulation() to complete respawn after the terrain is generated. This allows consistently selecting a safe respawn position and fixes crashes when respawning if the spawn location was in ungenerated terrain.

There remains a problem that ragequit respawns are still only handled right after PlayerJoinEvent, which leads to the original spawn terrain being sent to the player, which is obviously very wasteful. However, that's a problem for a later commit.",94,55,1,1

While it's not actually necessary to add these functions (since people could just use getFile() . ""/resources/whatever.yml"" instead), this helps preserve the convention of using the `resources` folder, which might be helpful for external tools.

As an example:
stream_get_contents($this->getResource(""lang/eng.ini""));
(which is actually incorrect, since it leaks a resource)
can now be replaced by
file_get_contents($this->getResourcePath(""lang/eng.ini""));

This story dates back to the days when getVariantBitmask() was introduced. The purpose of this function was to allow the variant info to be extracted from the metadata, for use with item drops. This was later changed to state bitmask for reasons I don't clearly recall.
In the great 4.0 refactor, we now store variant magic numbers separately, so we don't need any generic bitmask to split up variant and state information anymore. Variant is now only ever serialized and never deserialized. The same thing goes for blockIDs. States are read from the world by matching the full stateID against a table of prefilled known blocks, so the variant doesn't need to be deserialized - only the state does, and the state metadata readers already do bit fuckery by themselves and don't need this mask - notice how little actual changes were required to get rid of this?",82,29,0,1

this has a number of implications:
- Console command outputs are now (obviously) not logged. This is consistent with every other type of command sender, be it RCON, players, or anything else.
- The assumption that the console command sender must be able to see the logger output is now broken, since the command sender can receive output separately from the logs.

In the future, it might be desirable to send the console command output to stderr instead of stdout, so that stdout can be silenced while still allowing commands to be used.

This cleans up some cargo-cult code poorly copied from Bukkit, which has negative performance effects and also makes internal event handling more complex than necessary.

## API changes
- Removed `EventExecutor` and `MethodEventExecutor`.
- A listener is no longer required for an event handler to be registered. Closure objects can now be used directly provided that they meet the conditions for registration.
- `PluginManager->registerEvent()` signature has changed: the `Listener` and `EventExecutor` parameters have been removed and a `\Closure $handler` has been added in its place.
- `RegisteredListener` now requires a `Closure` parameter instead of `Listener, EventExecutor`.

## Behavioural changes
These changes reduce the execution complexity involved with calling an event handler. Since event calls can happen in hot paths, this may have visible positive effects on performance.

Initial testing reveals a performance improvement of ~15% per event handler call compared to the old method.",49,25,0,1

closes #3080 

If plugins fail to load for some reason, it's highly likely that some critical functionality of the server is compromised. For example:
- if an NPC plugin fails to load, all custom entities added by that plugin will be deleted from worlds
- if a world protection plugin fails, players will be able to grief your otherwise immutable lobby map
- if a worldgen plugin fails, worlds using custom generators won't load
- if a permission plugin fails, players might have access to commands and features they aren't supposed to have
- the list goes on...

This change makes the server commit graceful suicide if any plugin fails to load for error-related reasons, including (but not limited to):
- Incompatible API version
- Missing dependencies
- Invalid plugin.yml
- Invalid main class

Plugins prevented from loading by `plugin_list.yml` are not considered errors and **are not** included in this change. If a plugin is disallowed from loading due to the `plugin_list`, the server will continue to run as if the plugin was not present.",67,67,1,1
