We are maintaining several branches at this time, e.g. release-3.0 and
main. However, cloning dubbo-go-samples for integrate testing is still from
master. This leads to CI failure on old branch, like release-3.0, when the
master branch have received some breaking changes. Therefore, the
dubbo-go-samples' branch is required to keep same as the target branch.
