- Run coverage as a wrapper of nosetests rather than using nosetest's coverage plugin.
  This fixes a problem where completely uncovered files were not reported.
- Make the build fail if coverage is under a threshold (currently 30%; we can increase it over time).
- Set up tox and make travis run tox.
  This makes it easier to run the same tests locally that are run by Travis.
- Use Travis' matrix feature to run tests in parallel with building docs.
- Add documentation about running tests
- Add missing documentation about installing the pandoc dependency
- Add a few missing words to the spelling list
- Add command to run flake8 (but don't run it automatically yet; I'll add that in a separate pull request once I've fixed the errors)",64,3,0

When running a long chain, @jcpeterson noticed that every so often the
mapping between the ""left"" and ""right"" buttons flipped. The error was
non-deterministic and hard to predict. After a long debugging session,
we realized that the order of infos returned by the
`node/<node_id>/infos` route is non-deterministic (or at least not
always sequential in node id). This is a fix that behaves properly no
matter what order the returned infos are sorted in.

- worker_id must be unique
- attempt to duplicate participant returns existing participant
- cannot create participant with same worker_id, but different

- assignment_id can be reused by different participants
- creating a participant with a non-unique assignment id marks other
participants with that assignment_id as replaced
- remove old function check_for_duplicate_assignments, this is now
handled at participant creation, not by notification receipt
- notifications are always assumed to apply to the most recent

# Major

- Disabled the behavior where the built image name is written to config.txt. This behavior was inconsistent with the other Dallinger deployment patterns, because it meant that if you deployed once, changed code in experiment.py, then redeployed, then the experiment would launch in the former version unless you remembered to delete the image name from config.txt.
- Heroku deployments were failing because the default `heroku_python_version` had been discontinued by Heroku. We have experienced similar problems in the past and have always had to update Dallinger. Now we have changed the behaviour such that, if `heroku_python_version` is not specified in the experiment config, then it will use the default Python runtime currently in use by Heroku.

# Minor

- Propagate more information from deployment-related functions (e.g. dashboard credentials) so that they can be used by wrapper functions.
- Print more information (e.g. dashboard credentials) in deployment-related functions.
- Better debugging logs for docker-ssh deployments.
- Move deployment info logs from `deployment-info_{experiment_id}.txt` to `deploy_logs/*` to avoid clutter.
- Move default `dallinger_develop_directory` to `/tmp/dallinger_develop` because the original location was not writable by default on Docker.
- Minor bugfixes in docker-ssh deployment/export.
- Rename config variable `docker_ssh_volumes` -> `docker_volumes` because it's relevant also when we're doing docker locally. 
- Some minor renaming of internal variables for consistency.",27,75,1
