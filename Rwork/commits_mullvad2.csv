- Fix removal of API access methods from daemon settings

When removing an API access method, we now compare the ID (hash) of the

settings. This is because using the `==`/`!=` operator on two
similiar `AccessMethod`s only differing in the `enabled` field will be
different from hashing the objects and comparing those instead. The hash
does not consider the `enabled` field in its calculation.",7,69,1,0,"2017-12-19 09:23:41","2096.27"

The tests for an installed version of the app isn't possible to run in
sequence. A lot of them requires the daemon to be in a specific state,
and some require the daemon to change state during the test. This means
that for the tests to be useful they have to be run individually when
the daemon is in the correct state. The `e2e:installed` alias has been
replaced with `e2e:sequential` which can be used to run tests against
the installed app by running `npm run e2e:sequential installed/<test>`.",18,60,1,1,"2017-12-19 09:23:41","1818.03"

The main activity and tv activity are both designed to be running as
singleTask and the app would crash if both were started. This would not
be common, but possible, on a phone or tablet, however this can
potentially occur frequently on Android TV (perhaps depending on OEM),
as both categories  LAUNCHER and LEANBACK_LAUNCHER are used. E.g.the tv
launcher would use LEANBACK_LAUNCHER whereas the settings app would use
LAUNCHER.

As the tv activity isn't used for any customization atm, this was fixed
by simply removing the tv activity and adding the LEANBACK_LAUNCHER
category to the main activity.",30,49,1,1,"2017-12-19 09:23:41","1498.94"

F-Droid requires the metadata to be present in a specific location which
isn't compatible with our mono-repo structure, therefore this change
moves the Gradle Play Publisher (GPP) directories to a location
compatible with F-Droid and adds a symlink at the location GPP expects,
which leads to the F-Droid location.

The reason for doing it this way rather than symlinking the other way
around is that we don't use GPP itself atm. Even if we start using it,
it's still easier to make sure everything is working (in regards to the
symlink) in the GPP build environment compared to the F-Droid build
environment.",29,50,1,1,"2017-12-19 09:23:41","1507.04"

Certain NM versions will overwrite systemd-resovled config when they're
reapplying existing config, this can be invoked `nmcli general reload
dns-full` or by receiving a new DHCP lease. NM will just wipe the config
for interfaces it doesn't have the config for in systemd-resolved, and
since our daemon prefers systemd-resolved over NM, our config would be
wiped. To fix this, I've changed the systemd-resolved DNS code to listen
to changes to the global DNS config and reapply the tunnel interface DNS
config if it's changed in any way.

To better seperate the conecrns, the systemd-resolved DBus specific code
was moved to the `talpid-dbus` crate, and the DNS code that manages the
state and applies changes remains in `talpid-core`.

One other solution that was considered was to just prefer NM over
systemd-resolved, and we already kind of could do that, but the coming
NM versions (1.28 and up) seem to not be able to manage DNS via it's own

A user reported the following:

I noticed that when Mullvad for Windows starts OpenVPN, an attempt is made to read the file
C:\etc\ssl\openssl.cnf. On most systems this file isn't present. By default Windows allows
any authenticated users to create new files in the system roots, meaning that a user can
created a directory structure C:\etc\ssl\ containing a file openssl.cnf.
When present the file will be read and processed by the OpenSSL library (OpenVPN).

A local attacker can abuse this situation by creating a configuration file containing
a malicious engine entry pointing to an attacker-controlled DLL. When the configuration
is processed, an attempt is made to load this DLL by the OpenVPN binary.
Since OpenVPN is running as LocalSystem, it is possible for any authenticated user to
run arbitrary code as LocalSystem.

Adding the no-autoload-config to the OpenSSL build options disable loading this file
on initialization. So I added this and re-built OpenVPN on all platforms.",41,25,0,1,"2017-12-19 09:23:41","750.76"

The verification script running on github would complain that the first
commit of a PR changed all of the locked down files if this commit was
unsigned. The reason was that in our github enviornment we don't fetch
the entire git history but instead only the needed commits (so called
shallow repository). The entire history is therefore folded into the
first commit in the shallow repo. Since this history contains
modifications of locked down files and since this commit is not signed
the script will think this commit modified files its not allowed to.
This fix deepens the shallow repo by 1 after fetching.
It also clarifies a print in verification script to be more descriptive.",9,66,1,0,"2017-12-19 09:23:41","1995.17"

indices to pinpoint which API access method to update.

- Add the useful `UUID` protobuf type definition, which
conveys more information that a raw string.

- General code cleanup
  - Fix some typos
  - Add some doc comments
  - Address several `TODO` comments
  - Fix `clippy` warnings
- Removed unused dependency `mullvad-api` from `mullvad-cli`
- Removed unused dependency `rand` from `mullvad-daemon`
- Rename `mullvad proxy` to `mullvad api-access`
- Rename `mullvad_types::api_access_method` -> `mullvad_types::access_method`
- Remove unused `mullvad api-access edit` arguments
- Fix `Display` for `ProxyConfig` printing arguments in the wrong order
- Re-phrase `mullvad api-access test`
  - If the API call failed, point out which tested access method that
  did not work.
- Fix missing `socket_bypass_tx` value for Android
- Refactor `ApiAccessMethod` proto definition
  - Simplify protobuf definitions of `SOCKS5` api access methods
    - Remove the `Socks5` enum in favor of implementing `Socks5Local` and
  `Socks5Remote` directly.
  - Move `enabled` and `name` out of the individual messages and put them
next to the `oneof access_method` in `ApiAccessMethod` proto definition
- Use derived `PartialEq` and `Hash` from `AccessMethod`
 - Instead of hand-rolling `Hash` and implementing an ad-hoc version of
 half of `PartialEq`, these can now be derived and used as one would

The tray window works great across different spaces, but it tends to have buggy behaviour on full screen spaces, especially after opening the tray window in one full screen space and switching to another. The tray window will try to switch back but disappear anyway as it loses focus.

By ensuring NSWindowCollectionBehaviorFullScreenAuxiliary is correctly set on the window (through win.setVisibleOnAllWorkspaces(true { visibleOnFullScreen: true } ) this should be fixed",14,63,1,0,"2017-12-19 09:23:41","1902.44"

As of Android 8 (API level 26), the system has a strict timer where the
service must run `startForeground` within seconds after being started as
foreground (`startForegroundService`).

To mitigate cases where the service has been too slow to reach the
target state, for instance when the tile service starts the vpn service
as foreground with the connect action, this change aims to always
promote the service to foreground when connect/disconnect actions are
provided. This solution relies on the service demoting itself to from
foreground in cases where it shouldn't run as foreground.",18,54,1,1,"2017-12-19 09:23:41","1644.98"

This fix makes sure that both `*.play.aab` and `*.aab`
bundles are supported and get the correct names.

Ideally the `sed` command which this commit touches
would be able to add the suffix using a small tweak
to the pattern like this:
`(MullvadVPN-.*-dev-.*)(\.apk|\.play\.aab|\.aab)`

However, that pattern would result in the suffix
being incorrectly placed due the greedy nature
of `sed` like the ""incorrect"" one below:

If `mullvad-daemon` was built with the `api-override` feature flag, the
new environment variable `MULLVAD_CONNCHECK_HOST` may be used to supply
a different hostname for the location checking endpoint than the
standard `am.i.mullvad.net`.

It is equivalent to replacing

`curl https://ipv4.am.i.mullvad.net/json`

with

`curl https://ipv4.{$MULLVAD_LOCATION_HOST}/json`

Note that this change applies to both IPv4 and IPv6 endpoints.

Log warning if `MULLVAD_CONNCHECK_HOST` is used in release builds. The
variable will have no effect if `mullvad-daemon` was built in release
mode, but it is good to let the user know this if he/she thinks
otherwise.",12,65,1,0,"2017-12-19 09:23:41","1981.46"

Create a script which verifies that a set of ""locked down"" files are not
changed in commits that have not been signed.

Create a github workflow that runs the script in the CI.

The script accepts --whitelist <commit> and --import-gpg-keys arguments.
The default settings are supposed to work on the build server without
importing the gpg keys from the trusted_keys.pub file and running with a
hardcoded whitelist commit.
Make the CI workflow use these arguments as it is supposed to in
.github.

The public keys that can be imported are specified as files in the ci/keys/
directory.

The files that are locked down are specified in the .github workflow as
a single source of truth. This requires some complicated parsing in the
verification script as well as a dependency from the verification script
to the workflow YAML. These are not ideal design choices however the
alternative is to not have a single source of truth for the locked down
files as the github workflow can not depend on an external file.

The mullvad signing key is named to be first in the list in order to be
imported first.

(triggered by the system) resulting in a auto-connect. To fix this, a

This is not fully supported by Android Studio due to a bug in Gradle,
however as this is an important security mechanism it should be set.
Upcoming versions of Android Studio seem to properly support the
checksum mechanism, as seen here:
https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/fixed-bugs/studio/2022.1.1#android-studio-electric-eel-canary-3-2022.1.1.3

If Android Studio complains when syncing, click the text saying:
'Use ""<checksum>"" as checksum for <url> and sync project'

- Re-phrase help texts for a lot of `mullvad api-access` commands
- Add to help texts for some `mullvad api-access` commands
- Compact the output of `mullvad api-access test`
- `mullvad api-access status` is changed to `mullvad api-access get` to
align with other `mullvad` commands.
- `mullvad api-access get` does not print the enabled/disabled status of
the shown access method
- Rotate access method if the currently active one is updated or removed

- Fix reset access method after `mullvad api-access test`
  After running `mullvad api-access test`, the previously used access
  method should be used, which was not the case previously.

- Fix `mullvad api-access use` API connectivity check
  - `mullvad api-access use` now runs a test-routine to check that the
  new access method will function before comitting to it. If this check
  fails, the previously used access method will be used instead
  - guarantee that `set_api_access_method` has finished upon returning.
  Make `mullvad_api::rest::next_api_endpoint` `async` and send a message
  upon completion. This is propagated to the caller of
  `next_api_endpoint` which can `await` the result",4,69,1,0,"2017-12-19 09:23:41","2105.31"

- Rename `mullvad_types::api_access.rs` -> `mullvad_types::access_method.rs`

- Rename `ApiAccessMethodId` to simply `Id`
  Prefer to prefix with module name `access_method` to disambiguate use
  of `Id` instead, like `access_method::Id`

- Remove dead code
  - Remove `AccessMethodSettingsUpdate`
  - Remove the `retry_attempt` struct field from
  `ApiConnectionModeProvider`, as it is no longer used for anything.

- Fix typos
  - `GetApiAddressess` is now correctly spelled `GetApiAddresses` (a
  single trailing ""s"")

- Deprecate the name `ApiAccessMethod` in favor of `AccessMethodSetting`
  - To decrease the confusion between `AccessMethod` &
  `ApiAccessMethod`. `AccessMethodSetting` adds some app-specific
  settings details on top of an `AccessMethod`, which is not too far
  fetched with the new naming convention.

- Refactor proto file

  - Rename protobuf message `AccessMethodSettingAdd` to `NewAccessMethodSetting`
  - `AccessMethod` is now its own message
  - `AccessMethods` is removed
  - Add `ApiAccessMethodAdd` protobuf message
    - The `ApiAccessMethodAdd` returns a `UUID` for the . One important
    change is that new `AccessMethodSetting`s are created in the daemon,
    rather than in the CLI/other clients. This means that the daemon now
    has full control over generating new `AccessMethodSetting`s from
    `AccessMethod`s.
    - Clean up conversion code to/from `AccessMethod` protobuf types
    - Simplify `UpdateApiAccessMethod` RPC
    - Remove the extranous `ApiAccessMethodUpdate` data type
    - get rid of `ApiAccessMethodUpdate` protobuf message. Use `UUID` of
    `ApiAccessMethod` to identify which struct to edit.
