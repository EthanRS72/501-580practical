The actual cause is described in:

To assure the test is fixed you can run run

```go
go test -race -tags integrationTest -count 10 -run TestMemtableThreshold_Replace ./adapters/repos/db/lsmkv

This was implemented through severeal commits that didn't apply to my
usual standards, i.e. staying non-breaking in between. I thus decided to
squash them all into a single commit to avoid reverting parts and end up
with a non-working state. The original commit messages were:

    gh-677: fix all existing tests, remove tests for keys package

    ... or remove those acceptance tests that are already tested at a
    unit test level.

    Since we have already removed the tests for the key packages and
    stubbed out their implementation, the removal of keys as outlined in
    #646 must happen immediately after.

    gh-677: make everything compile again

    gh-677: add Ref type with options to parse from and stringify into

    The intent is to clean up this models.SingleRef mess that is spread
    throughout the validation and database packages. This new type
    should be the only way to extract info about refs and can easily be
    parsed from the API values and back into the API values to make sure
    we have an easy way to use around the API without mixing up API
    design and business logic.

    gh-677: remove obsolete props from cref Model

    This currently breaks in quite a few places because we don't seem to
    have a good isolation between api constructs and internal
    constructs.  Most of the time this isolation happens through using
    schema datatypes when talking to the db connectors, however in this
    case the models.SingleRef seems to be widely used in both validation
    and even the janus connector. This unfortunately leads to a
    massively breaking change when changing the model. Next up we need
    to clean up the fallout.

    The original reason for even starting this change was that
    acceptance tests would fail with invalid uuid for $cref which is now
    indeed a URI, rather than a UUID.

    gh-677: fix some more tests

    gh-677: udpate url strucutre in imporeter and make it succeed

    This can be seen as some sort of a spike to figure out the happy
    path.  While the importer succeeds it currently breaks all kinds of
    tests and is in no way complete.

    However, we pulled some good learnings out of this and now know what
    parts are affected and what aren't.

    We should consider squashing this branch in the end, so we don't end
    up with individually breaking builds on our trunk.",90,33,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1018.56"

the entire network/getmeta package. However, I then found out that the
getmeta package isn't as well isolated as I though it was. It leaks

Note: (copy paste form a code comment)

---
We cannot do an exact check of whether the user specified that
they wanted this class as part of their SelectProperties because
we would only find out the exact className after resolving this.
However, resolving a network ref is a) not the concern of this
particular database connector and b) exactly what we want to
avoid. The point of checking whether this class is desired is to
prevent unnecassary network requests if the user doesn't care
about this reference.

So instead, we can at least check if the user asked about any
classes from this particular peer. If not we can safely determine
that this particular network ref is not desired.

to commit and some refactoring on the janus connector

The network packages has sub-packages for each new branch in the tree,
such as Get, GetMeta, aggregate, etc. However, while tyring to write a
component test for GetMeta, we learned that in fact some of the GetMeta
logic (and that of other subpackages as well) is not in fact in the
seemingly isolated packages, but rather mixed up in the network
(root) package.

This refactor commit moves those separate concerns into their individual
packages. To make sure we don't break anything a few component tests
were added, that assert the successful creation of the graphql schema.
Since this part was previously untested on anything other than a e2e
level, we discovered lots of edge cases that would lead to errors, e.g.:

- A peer with an empty schema could block the creation
- A peer with a class without properties would lead to errors in the
Aggregate package, which blocked the creation
- etc...

All errors we discovered through the new component test were fixed.",88,34,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1022.51"

This could use to a situation where we would accept the cancel signal
while the buffer was still filled. This would in turn mean we terminate
the save operation with unsaved elements in the queue.

After discussion within the team, we don't see any reason for the
buffered channel (anymore), so we don't think we'll lose anything by
using a regular, unbuffered channel.

A new intergration test which uses a real `db.Repo` with the classifier
has been added as I could not reproduce the bug with a storage fake. I
still don't know what exactly it took to reproduce it, but I assume it
was a combination of timings that happen to be very present with a real
DB, but aren't present with the fake - although I added various delays
to the fake.

additional lookup (but not request) in some cases, but prevents an
impossible to resolve situation in others.

Note: The lookup is not yet ideal, as we seem to overwrite elements that
appear twice in the list with different select properites. (e.g. at the

Such scratch files exist if a crash occured while two files were being
combined. The presence of such a file means that the process was not
finished and the file is not usable.

Prior to this fix, startup was blocked because the name of the file
couldn't be parsed. Thix fix does not alter the parsing, but actually
removes the file, knowing that it's not usable. The next combinig cycle
will simply create another one.

Note that this commit also changes the commit log switching threshold,
which helped discover this bug. Previously it would be switched at 500MB
and combined up to 1.75*500MB. While the latter number hasn't changed, a
switch now already occurs at 100MB, leading to smaller files and
slightly more frequent combining/condensing cycles. This improves
startup times after a crash, since the latest (uncondensed) log is now
smaller than it typically would be.

As outlined in #413 we aren't capable of resolving the network refs yet,
that will be tackled in #660.

Since we don't resolve yet, we also can't test this feature as a journey
test yet. However, since we have too many of those anyway, it is now
tested with a unit test (technically rather a component test) at the
local_get level. There was already an existing component test for
local.Get without network references. Having the combination of both was
a good helper to test that everything still works, both when network
peers are present and when they are not present.

Being able to run those test without any dependencies in under a  second
is a massive feedback cycle time reduction compared to the acceptance
tests which take about 10 minutes.",98,33,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1000.55"

Basically this is just deleting a bunch of code. Previously we had to

somehting like

WeaviateB->Things->City->name and was placed at the level of Network.Get.

We had to rewrite this to just say Things->City->name (i.e. remove the
peer name) and inject the filter at the correct place after
Local.Get.

proxy them together with everything else. So no more parsing is required

The following situation caused an issue. Imagine there are two commit
logs in chronological order:

Log 1:
- AddLink for Node/Level/Link 0/0/1
- AddLink for Node/Level/Link 0/0/2

Log 2:
- ClearLinks for Node/Level 0/0
- AddLink for Node/Level/Link 0/0/3
- AddLink for Node/Level/Link 0/0/4

It should be quite obvious that after reading all the logs back in the
correct order node 0 will have the connections [3,4] at level zero, as
there was a ""clear"" event in between.

However, prior to this fix we would have ended up with [1,2,3,4] because
the clear information got lost when condensing each log independently.
This fix makes sure that information that relates to changes from prior
commit logs is kept when condensing a commit log. The actual bug was
when reading (as part of condensing) as we used the clear only to clear
the links (which from the perspective of log 2 were already empty). This
led us to condensing log 2 to just ""add 3, add 4"", whereas the correctly
condensed log would have been ""clear, add 3, add 4"". This is the case
now.

To write the tests needed for this fix, it was required to add some
functional options to the commit logger to control the commit log size
thresholds. As of now these are not yet exposed to the user, but this
would also add value.

fixes #1868

Potential follow-up tasks:

1. Expose Commitlog configuration (e.g. thresholds) to user, so they can
   finetune them to their needs
2. Clean up the redundant and partly unused code, and the confusion
   between condensor/condensor2 and deserializer/deserializer2",68,72,1,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","2179.98"

Generally the prepared interface (RWMutex) had to be implemted. There
were a few changes to it. Since the Lock is now a remote lock, we need
a remote connection. This in turn means that locking and unlocking can
fail. Thus the signature was changed to include error returns.

Note that this error is currently not handled well in this POC, however
an action item to replace the makeshift error handling with proper error
handling has been created.

Another major change is that we no longer use one lock, that is passed
through the entire app by reference. This is because the etcd RWMutex
works fundamentally different. The ""shared"" stated will be kept
server-side, this means locally the type should only be shared from a
single Lock to an Unlock. This is not yet documented well on the code
and will be added in an upcoming commit.",91,34,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1030.27"

Right now we have an issue where duplicate schemas can lead to duplicate

It's very hard right now to get feedback for that, as you basically have
to run the entire acceptance suite, with actual peers. A unit test
should be much easier to provide feedback on that. However, we first
need the changes from PR #649 becasue they substantially change the
method signarture with regards to what peers are. Previously there were
just a []string and afterwards they'll be a complex object with

* Introduce GraphQL interface
* Simplify error handling during schema generation
* Design GraphQL resolvers
* Remove original Graphql API
* Reverse function results of schema.Schema.FindPropertyDataType
* Fix bugs in getting classes
* Use has() instead of property() in Gremlin code
* Remove illegal date format from demo dataset.
* Import Actions too in fixture importer
* add support to fetch listClasses for a specific class
* Parse paths and value's from the filters.
* Capture panics in the spawned go routines so that Weaviate won't crash
* Split filters into multiple files
* Fix parsing references in filters
* Extract moved filter tests from local->get tests
* Remove concurrency bug from thunk in filters
* Add tests for operands & superfluous elements in filter clauses.
* Parse out nested relations from GraphQL
* Janus connector: only optionally set the variables in getClass
* Fix naming in actions acceptance tests
* Add test to patch action and set a reference
* Make it possible to patch synchronously
* Regenerated HTTP client code
* Handle float types as well during updates
  Combined with silent failures because of async-by-default behavior, this was _very_ hard to debug.
* Log stack traces in panics in the resolver go routine.
* Move presence check into the case of primitive types.
* Ref types start with a capital in GraphQL, and will therefore not be found.
* Make updates synchronous by default
* Fix importer
* Acceptance tests for GraphQL queries
* Load fixtures on Travis
* Update call to FindPropertyDataType to reflect change in ret types.
* Fix concurrency issue in building common get filters.
* Force serial creation of schema in test. This happens too in the callback

To reduce coupling a RegisterHandler was added to the network
interface, every network must implement this handler and use the getter
function that is being passed to retrieve the current schema.

This happens asynchronously (and repeatedly) which is why the ""register
getter"" way was chosen - so that the getter can be called later.

The signature of the passed getter is a small interface (""Schema
Getter"") which tells the underlying type to provide a Schema() method
which in turn provides the current schema.

Most likely when a schema should be retrieved locking is involved,
however the network wants to stay agnostic of the internals of how a
schema provider deals with locking. In turn any type that wants to
implement the SchemaGetter, should take care of locking as part of the

The memtable for Map is a binary tree so it's always sorted. However,
since this is type 'Map' each ""row key"" holds a map. This map was
unsorted in the past. In #1832 we introduced a change that made sure
this change would always be sorted ON DISK, i.e. in the segments. It was
very natural to also keep it sorted in the memtable, as we did not have
to do any sorting when flushing. However, the performance tests on
imports that make heavy use of the inverted index had a large
performance degradation after #1832. In a test I did locally the import
time went up by over 30%.

This fix goes back to keeping the KV pairs unsorted and making each
change an append only operation. This means it now needs to be sorted in
just two places (as opposed to on every single insertion):

1. On a read query. Those should be rare on memtable, since memtables
   are mostly meant for writing. The added overhead here (minimal) is
   not a problem since it was also there before #1832
2. When flushing. Flushing is an async operation and the small overhead
   of sorting each row's Map KVs is neglible.

This new implementation has the same import speed as prior to #1832
while keeping all the runtime benefits of having the KV pairs sorted on
disk.

So, this seems to boil down to the following:

- There is an old bug in graphql-js (fixed in 2017) where the package
  ignores the isDeprecated field, but instead uses
  deprecationReason!=null to check whether a field is deprecated. This
  bug has been fixed a long time ago: https://github.com/graphql/graphql-js/pull/1035
- However, it seems various other dependencies have not updated to
  include the fix, see https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql/issues/504#issuecomment-549080559
- The graphql-go package has been (correctly) using an empty string (as
  is the default value for string) in Go if no deprecation reason is
  set. As ""isDeprecated"" this should not ever have mattered
- Since the bug from bullet one still seems to be present in many
  packages - as we have seen with the latest GraphiQL reason - the
  graphql-go team have now instead added a new resolver which explicitly
  sets the ""deprecationReason"" to null (rather than """") if not set. This
  was released in v0.7.9 which this commit udpates to

There were namely these issues that made working with and extending the
current package problematic:

1.) a lot of concerns were mixed up in a single file that made it
incredibly difficult to find what you were looking for. This single file
has now been split up into 9 files

2.) The code itself used unnecessarily long function and variable names
all prefixed with the name of the package, etc. This redundant info made
the code very hard to read. This has been simplified.

3.) There was some obvious low-hanging fruit regarding repition in the
big switch-case to split up by property type. This has been extracted
into a function and made much more concise.

Overall I feel like the package is now in a decent state to start
building new features on top of the exisitng code base.",89,33,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1013.37"

We seem to be doing some interesting type conversion, we're first
marshalling the entire graphql response to JSON and then unmarshalling
it again into the go-swagger resopnse type. This seems to work fine for
most cases, but there is an edge cases where it breaks miserably:

When the graphql error response contains a list the path array will be
something like [""Get"", ""Things"", 0, ""foobar""]. Notice the third element
is a number, whereas all the other ones are string. Therefore this type
is defined in the graphql package as []interface{}. Howevever, we are
using OpenAPI2 with go-swagger, where variable types (""oneOf"", ""anyOf"")
are not supported yet. Therefore the code generated by go-swagger has
the path field as []string.

The above case breaks the marhshal->unmarshal->marshal chain. Previously
it would fail silently. This commit makes sure the failure is at least
not silent anymore. Nevertheless it's not a very nice response yet. We
should improve upon this by actually converting from one response type
to the other (we can then simply convert the int to a string), rather
than using this marshal->unmarshal-marhsal magic. (#669)",97,33,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1003.58"

An ID makes an object unique in Weaviate, but it's still not enough to
only run deduplications based on it. This is because with
SelectProperties, i.e. the user-specified instructions to traverser the
graph, there is a difference. For example if A has a reference to B of
class ""BestClass"" and the user asks for all references from A of type
""WorstClass"", we will send a request that won't have a result. If the
user now asks for all references of clasess ""WorstClass"", ""BestClass""
these are clearly two different requests even with the same id (since we
don't know the class yet at resolve time.) If we were to dedup only on
ID (as we did before), we'd send only the first request (asking for
WorstClass) and would end up with no results.",95,46,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1389.49"

copy/pasted from the unresolve method:

Assume the following situation: the depth limit is two and you have a fully
cached object going two levels deep with a hot cache. Now a third object is
added referencing the original object. Since the cache of the referenced
object is hot, we don't need to do any additional resolving. However, we
can't just copy over the ref tree either, as it is already 2 levels deep. In
other words we'd end up with a three level deep cache. Over large schemas
this seemingly small inconvenience adds up to massive issues, see
https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate/issues/1003 and
https://github.com/semi-technologies/weaviate/issues/1004.

To remedy this, we need to parse the hot cache from the referenced object
recursively and undo any resolved cache once wewould otherwise cross the

The reason for the issue was two-fold:

1. The process of finding a new entry point takes time, if two
   concurrent delete requests came in in that same time, we could end up
   in a situation where two runs competed with one another, leading to
   unexpected beahvior. This is now prevented by a deletion lock that
   makes sure the critical parts about deletion happen sequentially.

2. While the findNewEntrypoint process is running a new insert might
   lead to an updated entryPoint. In this case the script would run
   through where there is no need. This in turn can lead to unexpected
   behavior. An ""early exit"" check was added to check if the entrypoint
   has changed while we are running the findNewEntrypoint script. If
   yes, then we can abort without making changes.",39,56,1,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1701.87"

The diskindex binary tree was extremely unbalanced leading to insane

perfectly balanced. This also helps us get rid of the rather hacky
shuffling beforehand.

This commit also starts writing into the inverted index, but currently
no reading from it is done.

Note that this commit also switches various commit loggers (in both HNSW
and in the lsmkv) to be buffered io writers as the many parallel.Write()
syscalls became very problematic. However, this means that we need to
introduce forced flushes at various points, such as after completing a

Why are we removing them?

- They have been turned off (with the env var) on CI for a while, so
right now they’re not adding any value

- The prototype is no longer the source of API changes. Newer changes
were implemented in weaviate first or in some cases only in weaviate

- One of the additional benefits of the tests was checkings that Object
names don’t collide in GraphQL. We have component tests in the graphql
packages that do that now

- With most of the resolvers being implemented we also have explicit
tests to see that the GQL endpoints work correctly end-to-end, i.e. both

The etcdv3 client requires the ctx as one of its parameters, this is a
good pattern that we should also aim to keep up. Ideally, the restapi as
constructed by go-swagger is the creator of a context and then
everything that happens as a result of an incoming rest request should
pass along the context. We are now passsing it along for everything

This bug surfaced a gap in our compaction tests. While we already had a

cursor. Bug #3592 was specific to accessing keys directly. Cursors would
have still worked fine, therefore the tests didn't catch this bug.

Janusgraph.

Getting the parsed filters back to their source string was not as easy
as anticipated. The graphql-go package parses them into
map[string]interface{} which is fine to read them.

However, this presents us with two problems:

1.) When we want to ""marshal"" them back into the graphql format, the
format is like JSON, but is not actually JSON. The keys can't be quoted.

2.) String values are quoted, as expected, but not every value is a
string value from the perspective of the graphql schema. Operators for
example are an enum, so they also shouldn't be quoted.

This problem is currently solved with two regular expressions, to strip
the quotes off of all keys and additionally to strip the quotes off of
the values for an operator key. Not the best-scaling approach, but the
where-Filter is luckily a relatively small and predictable set of
fields. We can always look for a more elaborate solution if we actually
run into issues because of this.",88,32,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","982.74"

In the reference batcher we previously attempted concurrent reads/writes
which aren't a problem per se. However, we could get into a situation
where we would mark a doc id as deleted before it was ever imported.
That would be problematic as doc ids on additional indices (such as
HNSW) are themselves immutable. So an import to a deleted doc id would
lead to issues, as we couldn't distuingish this from an attempt to reuse
a doc id.

As a side-effect the fix for this also made the ref-batcher slightly
more efficient, as we remove unnecessary updates on the ""same"" object
which was touched multiple times in one batch and therefore received
multiple increases on the doc id",41,55,1,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1682.05"

The janusgraph/meta subpackage now has two components:

- The Query Builder contains everything that happens before we interact
with Janus, i.e. it uses our parsed arguments and creates a query based
on the desired props. The query is modelled to return the closest
possible result that we need for the graphQL API. Where an exact match
between our requirements for the graphQL API and what Janus returns is
not possible, the next component comes into place:

- The Query Processor sends the Query to Janus and then post-processes
the results where required. It merges props, where Janus decides to
split a map with multiplie keys into an array back into a map.
Additionally it can do arbitrary post processing per type.

This commit also adds the ""totalTrue"" prop to boolean props. In Janus
the counting of true/false props is one atomic unit, so we don't
seperate by counting true and false. I.e. whenever you ask for one of
the two, we also retrieve the other one. This in turn gives us the
safety to know that both will always be present. We can thus use the
post-processing step to calculate the percentages as well. Something
that I couldn't figure out how to do it Janus directly. However, this
computation is never expensive, so that shouldn't be an issue.

The atomic retrieval of both the true and false prop does however mean
that with the current logic of the query builder if both props are
specified we would retrieve both props twice (or even four times if all
four of totalTrue, totalFalse, percentageTrue, percentageFalse are set).
The next commit will include a small logic to prevent thus. Thus as of
now any prop other than the 'totalTrue' will error.",88,33,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1014.64"

This seemingly simple change has quite some major implications. We were
returning a thunk previously to avoid our results bubbling up to higher
resolvers.

This behavior was a bug in go-graphql that has been fixed in v0.7.7:
https://github.com/graphql-go/graphql/issues/340 We are currently on
v0.7.5.

This commit removes the thunk and simply returns the results directly,
in order to make this work we had to introduce a new resolver at the
level of the reference field. Additionally we needed to add a
ResolveType function at the level of the classUnion (that is used to
for the reference field).

This has a nice side-effect however: We can also use the resovler to
determine whether it's a network ref or a local ref and in the case of
the former send out a query to the remote peer. (This is not in this
commit yet, this is the goal of this issue)",97,33,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1003.26"

It was a combination of 3 issues all with similar symptopms:

1. Flushlocks were missing on various Bucket methods, thus leading to
   reads/writes into non-existing memtables, etc.
2. Various read queries only considered the active memtable or the disk
   segments, however, there at times there is a second memtable - the
   one that's currently flushing. Whenever this is active, we also need
   to read from this one, as the objects present in here are currently
   not present in either the active or already present in a loaded disk
   segments
3. There was yet another issue where a NotFound error from the
   segmentindex package was not handled correctly. Interestingly, this
   issue was quite hard to spot as it occurred non-deterministically:
   This particular code path was only touched when the bloom filter
   delivered a false positive, as the bloomfilter's 'NotFound' was
   handled correctly

Note: The fixes are included only for 'replace' strategy, but for both
regular Gets and Cursors. The other strategies will follow shortly.",32,61,1,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1863.21"

For some reason the previous code used a different method to add many
refs to single refs. The single-ref code had extensive validation (for
local refs) that was skipped for many-refs.

The new code simply loops over the many refs and for each runs the same
code that we have for a single ref. This means the switch between
network and local as well as the additional validation for local refs is
now exactly the same.

The importer script previously wasn't capable of adding refs with
cardinality many. This has been fixed, but only for things, as part of
this commit.

We need to identify whether the current importer should become a
strategic tool (possibly as part of the weaviate-cli) or if it's just a
helper for our local dev setup and tests. If it's the latter it's good
the way it is, but for the former we would have to improve upon it quite

This is a rough draft, I think the approach should work, but it's not
complete. I basically picked this up between two larger tasks and plan
on continuing it next time, I'm between tasks.

It uses an index-based approach and an mmap where the index is kept in
mem and the payload is mmaped. A rough calculation showed that with a
30M hnsw graph, the index would only grow to 600MB, whereas with the old
memory-based approach the mem requirements would considerably higher:

For example, with M of 64 and even ignoring levels higher than 0, at
30M objects the requirements would have been 30GB already, so the new
solution is about 99% more memory efficient",38,64,1,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1960.25"

So we don't accidentally create more entries to be read next time while
we're reading. Since we're only reading from disk there is no need to
write anything to disk, as we don't need the ""safety"". If something
fails we can just read the same file again.

The above scenario led to a weird case of duplicating the logs over and
over again when an external factor (in this case a Kubernetes
initialDelaySeconds timeout) caused restarts. This then lead to more
data being parsed on the next run, making a success less likely with
each round.

In addition we are using a buffered reader when ingesting WALs, as there
was an incredibly high amount of syscalls because of the small chunks
being read.",42,66,1,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","2022.17"

in inverted index check old and new beacon format for backward compat

The beacon is used in the inverted index. This is because if you resolve
a ref you need to match against the beacon. Think of the following
pseudo-schema/object combination:

County(name==""Germany"") -> hasCaptial -> City(name==""Berlin"").

In Weaviate this would be roughly expressed as the following City:

properties: {
  ""name"": ""Germany""
  ""hasCaptial"": [{
    ""beacon"": ""weaviate://localhost/City/<id-of-Berlin>""
  }]
}

Now if a user where to filter for ""Give me all the countries which a
capital named Berlin"", this filter is a two step process.

1. Weaviate must identify all Cities where name==""Berlin"". This is a
   simple inverted index lookup for the term ""Berlin"" on the City class.
   The result is a list of IDs (or a single ID in this case).

2. Now the user must find all Countries that link to the list of cities
   with the IDs from (1). This is yet another inverted index lookup. In
   this case the values for the ""hasCaptial"" inverted index bucket is
   the beacon format.

<-- This is the point where we get problems with two beacon formats.
Because we chose one at index time, and now we're using one at search
time. If they match, all is fine, but if they don't match, it's a
problem, as could be proven by the failing integration test that matched
for referenced values.

I was initially thinking, we could solve this by indexing both formats.
But this was a wrong line of thinking. We cannot do this because the old
format is only deprecated, so even on new imports we may end up with
both formats.

Instead I chose two look for both formats at search time. This is not
100% ideal because this introduces an additional cost. We should thus
aim to remove this backward-compatibility fix as soon as we can
guarantee that we will have no more old beacons, such as in v2.0.0.

Basically the fix now does a lookup in step two for two values chained
using an ""OR"" operation. Instead of looking for just one format, we are
now looking for

weaviate://localhost/City/<id-of-Berlin>
OR
weaviate://localhost/<id-of-Berlin>

Always one of the two should match.

Please also note the TODO-comment I added to the ref-filter integration
tests. This test currently only uses the old format, but I think it
would be nice to change it so it uses a mix of old and new formats, so
that we have a good guarantee that mixing formats works well.",51,75,1,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","2285.33"

The hnsw index is most efficient if the vectors are held in memory.
However, we cannot assume that the user has infinite memory available.
Thus we can limit it with a simple cache. The cache is primitive in the
sense that it simply gets purged when it's full.

As part of the spikes preceeding this we have also investigated smarter
caches, that would purge entries with fewer recent hits first, etc.
However the orcehstration of that turned out to be more expensive than
the benefit it provided.

The cost of fillign the cache is not astronomically high, so this seems
to be a good solution for now.

The size is currenlty hard-coded to 10k items. This should get us far
enough on small datasets and still should have a decent performance even
if it gets purged a lot on medium sized set.

To support large sets (where it's a given that cluster nodes are not
tiny) ideally we'd make the limits dynamic. If there is still
allocatable RAM (keeping in mind that the key/value store is also
mmapped and needs mem), it could grow. This would especially make it
easier on datasets with a lot of indices/shards where we can't easily
predict which index/shard will take the highest load.",42,52,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1568.96"

This PR makes the visited list faster not necessarily reducing the amount of used memory.

This is because the same approach (set as []int8 ) is used as before but the implementation has been changed

The main advantage of the new implementation are:

The list is compact because it can be hold as a value (no pointer needed).
It reduces the number of times the list needs to be resized because it uses variable growth. This is the major difference to the current implementation which use fix growth (1000 bytes). This will come in handy when inserting huge number of objects.

Previously we would invalidate all affected classes at once. However,
this means that in rare cases ES would return a class matching a long
path (e.g. n=5) before a short path (e.g. n=1). If a refresh period
now happens when the long path was already updated, but the short path
wasn't, we would end up with the long rebuilding its cache before the
short has been invalidated. This means that we'd rebuild the long path
cache with the old/stale/uncahnged inner data. (Essentially we had a
race)

This resulted in some test flakyness as most of the times a refresh
cycle didn't happen to be exactly between two invalidation updates - but
sometimes they were. By fixing the underlying root problem, we seem to
have removed all flakyness around it as well.",151,42,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1272.48"

See this inline comment, for we have changed the order/priority of
assembling the predicates:

Note that we are first iterating over the term, then over the prop. This
is because the terms are already an ordered list where the match with
the highest certainty is the first item. Janus also imposes a limit, so
we need to abort if we get too many predicates. Assuming we have 20
props and 20 matches, by iterating over the matches first, this way,
we'll be able to cover about the 6 best matches on all props. If we
split the order of iteration, we would cover all matches, but completely
ignore 14 out of 20 props.",126,36,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1099.47"

Previously the c11y inside the weaviate container was a deciding factor
between using a dev or production image. Now we can finally get rid of
this big anti-pattern. Since configuring the contextionary is simply
pointing it to the right URL now, there is no more need to have separate
proceses. Instead we can just use one image for weviate and change the
contextionary image as we like

reduction in build times)",105,38,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1154.76"

This commit allows parsing a collection node into a reusable buffer.
Additonally it supports a reusable segment cursor for collections that
makes use of this functionality. As a final step this new cursos is used
as part of the map compactor.

This commit is the final step on this allocation reduction journey. Out
of the remaining 126GB of allocations maybe only 2-3 GB are left from
the map compactor. However, these also include things that stay on the

it was also allowed to match the hostname under which the weaviate

allowed for a local reference.

For this we need to make sure that we index string props either as

""exact-match"" style searches. Previously whenever the gremlin query was
`eq(string)` it would fall back to a composite index even if other
paramaters where included that would have been better answered with the
mixed index.

We now only have a single composite index left: for uuid - guaranteeing
to make uuid unique, somethign that a mixed index cannot do.

This should improve performance at scale considerably.

Note that indexing with the external index is not always instant, so we
had to adjust some tests which were implicitly assuming an atomic
create-and-index process. They are now waiting for a created thing or
action to actually become available on the index before performing
further operations on them.",91,34,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1046.24"

Previously they needed a temporary file directory to write to the disk.
Since changing from the local implementation to the etcd implemenation
we previously weren't able to run this test anymore. As part of the POC
this was acceptable, but now when moving to production-quality code, we
need it again of course.

I saw two options:
a) Turn this into an integration test
b) Fake etcd.

Since we were using only two methods on the etcd client (Get() and
Put()) faking was the much cheaper option. The fake is a very simple
map[string]string as a KeyValue store which gives us everything we need
to make the tests pass again :)",91,34,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1030.52"

Thanks to the way we built the filter query builder in a very isolated
and pluggable fashion in #680, we could simply plug them in right here.

Interestingly the first (explorative) tryout of the filters highlighted
a small issue that I previously hadn't thought about. To calculate the
percentage of bool values we rely on having a count for true and false.
However, while using the filteres I narrowed down the result sets of
Cities where all results would have 'isCapital == true'. This led to an
error in the meta aggregator:

  got a successful response from janus, but could not merge the results:
  could not postprocess 'map[string]interface
  {}{""boolGroupCount"":map[string]interface {}{""true"":1}}': boolProps did
  not contain any info about no of props which are 'false', got
  'map[string]interface {}{""true"":1}

However, filters or not, it is of course completely viable to have
result sets where all boolean props are true, or all boolean props are
false.

So, we have to introduce a fix for this in an upcoming commit.",89,33,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1016.33"

We have two docker-compose files in this repo. So if you start up the
dev one and then the test one it won't be able to do a poper
docker-compose down, because some containers are running in the same
network that are not specified in the current compose file.

Docker-compose considers those containers ""orphans"". By default stopping
a network with orphans errors, as they might still be in use. We can
circumvent that by specifying the `--remove-orphans` flag which means
all orphaned containers in the current network wil be stopped as well.

This gives us the ability to create a clean slate before our test runs.",91,32,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","988.42"

Previously we would first try to remove the property from our own cached
(and stored in etcd) schema representation, then remove it from the db.
The latter would fail because it tries to query to former about the
property.

This would leave us in an inconsistent state, creating all kinds of
other fallout.

While fixing this, we discovered that plenty of other endpoints in both
REST and GQL would fail after a property was deleted. This should also
be addresesd with this now.

The two special cases that we can run into are if either there is no
class found or we have classes, but don't have any properties to search
on. This would lead to errors down the line in the connector. However,
instead of having to handle this special case in every single connector
we're handling it in the earliest possible layer now, i.e. in the
graphQL resolver.

This means that the database connector now has the guarantuee that there
will always be at least one class and one property to search for. This
gives now guarantuee that they ""match"" though. I.e. it could still be
possible that we get classA and property classB.propertyFoo back.",88,34,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1042.58"

I must have accidentally ticked that off on my todo list, because it was
ticked off but when recording a demo video I realized that the feature
was never built. It is now.

Note that there's currently a bit of confusion about capitalization of
refProps, such as ""InCountry"". On user-facing parts we have them
uppercased, but on schema imports (and therefore in the database) they
are lowercased like ""inCountry"". I don't really see a reason for that
and it currently leads to some ugly transformations, such as
string.Title() being used, when displaying the prop and untitle(), i.e. a
custom untitling function, being used when taking in user input.

I want to discuss and potentially fix this confusion as part of #677.",90,33,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1017.38"

The merge implementation relied on the fact that - in the old
implemtation - an explicit vector update was the only thing that could
lead to a new doc id. Now that every update leads to a new doc id, the
old implementation would sometimes write into the vector index with a
nil-vector

Note that we currently still have the same issue on the batch-reference
which also relied on the fact that a ref update would never alter the
vector position. It is marked with a TODO and needs to be fixed before
the completion of this issue.",41,55,1,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1681.83"

This PR aims to improve the DX for the dev server script:

* global variables are no longer hard-coded, they are taken from the
  environment if not set. If not provided defaults are used.
* repetition is removed among the invidivual configurations by moving
  all variables that are the same for every config to the global level

This change is non-breaking and running the script without setting any
env vars has the same effects as before. However, you can now customize
it. For example to change the log format to JSON and to run with a

Previously we would parallelize batch requests by spawning different
goroutines per item and send one request to janus. At scale this leads
to a massive HTTP overhead and a lot of network traffic.

This POC tries to send a single request per batch to the connector which
includes all vertices to be added.

WARNING: This is very much POC code that is NOT production ready. If it
proves to work well, it will get imporoved.

Things that are currently keeping this from beign production ready are:
- only doing this for things, actions is still the old way
- we don't return meaningful data
- validation results are completely ignored",91,34,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1046.53"

Previoulsly we pretended that every prop would always be a bool, this
enabled us to start quickly and not have to worry about analyzing the
type of the individual property.

Since we have now added the second type (int) this switching was
required and thus added. So far we only support ""count"" as a statistical
analysis prop, but have a good base to add others as well.

Please note that the way we aggregate ints leads to a special case when
only one prop is requested:

  just one analysis prop is a special case, because in multiple cases we
  are using select(<1>,<2>, ...<n>), this means we will receive a map
  that has the selections as keys. However, if we only ask for a single
  prop, Gremlin doesn't see a need to return a map and simply returns
  the primitive value. This will of course either break our
  post-processing or will not have the format the graphql API expects.
  We thus need to add an additional as().project().by() step to wrap the
  primtive prop in a map - but only if it's only a single analysis prop.",88,33,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1015.34"

The drop command is also called as part of compactions, so we can now

However, currently we are also relying on the first segment init after
the compaction to build all files again. This works, but can probably be
optimized further:

the existing segments can simply be added. Right now we would

so far, we can only aggregate the count, nothing else yet. Additionally,
we are currently pretending that grouping is always done by primitive
props. Additionally no post-processing is happening yet, however
post-processing will be necessary as we are currently returning
aggregation keys such as ""prop_18__count"", this is because they have to
be unique in our gremlin query across all props, but will repeat in the
graphql api.

These limitations will be overcome with future commits.

Additionally, please note that we already have edge case handling for
queries with just a single property and queries with just a single
aggregator. The reaon for why these are edge cases are extensively

In order to do so, the previous filter implementation has been removed
entirely. To my surprise not a single high-level test fails because of
this. :(

What does this hard-coded POC do?
- always assume there is just a single filter condition
- always assume the filter condition is ""lessthan""
- always assume the filter prop and its value is a number
- completely ignore reference props

If all these conditions are met, we actually have a working
implementation. These means the spike was a success and we now have a
relatively clear path ahead to build working filters for
- all primitive props
- combinations of primitive prop filters

Since this is a relatively well-isolated concern, I will build the new
logic in a sub-package and make sure the new code is test-driven, thus
hopefully also improving the quality of the current implemenation.",89,33,0,1,"2016-03-30 15:03:18","1010.48"
