written that target status updates from a specific DpId and of a specific

Support subscribe/unsubscribe MQTT topics and trigger specified event with the subscribed MQTT topic.
You can subscribe a MQTT topic and assign an event name. Once we received subscribed MQTT message, an event will be automatically triggered. So you can set up a rule with ""ON EVENT#<event_name> DO ..."" to do whatever you want based on this MQTT message. The payload is passed as a parameter once the event been triggered. If the payload is in JSON format, you are able to get the value of specified key as parameter.
For example, if you have a Tasmota based thermostat and multiple temperature sensors in different place, usually you have to set up a centre home automation system like Domoticz to control the thermostat. Right now, with this new feature, you can write a rule to do this.
Two new commands in Rules:
1. Subscribe
Subscribe a MQTT topic (with or without key) and assign an event name to it.
Command format:
	Subscribe [<event_name>, <topic> [, <key>]]
		This command will subscribe a <topic> and give it an event name <event_name>.
		The optional parameter <key> is for parse the specified key/value from MQTT message
			payload with JSON format.
		In order to parse value from two level JSON data, you can use one dot (""."") to split the key into two section.
		Subscribe command without any parameter will list all topics currently subscribed.
2. Unsubscribe
Unsubscribe specified MQTT event.
Command format:
	Unsubscribe [<event_name>]
		Unsubscribe a topic subscribed by specify the event name.
		If no event specified, Unsubscribe all topics subscribed.
Examples:
1.
	Subscribe BkLight, Tasmota/BackyardLight/stat/POWER
		And define a rule like:
	Rule1 on event#BkLight=ON do ruletimer4 60 endon
2.
	Subscribe DnTemp, Tasmota/RoomSensor1/stat/SENSOR, DS18B20.Temperature
		Define a rule to deal with the MQTT message like {""Time"":""2017-02-16T10:13:52"", ""DS18B20"":{""Temperature"":20.6}}
	Rule1 ON EVENT#DnTemp>=21 DO ... ENDON",27,25,0,0

* handle get local time requests from the MCU.

from what i can tell from the tuya serial communication protocol
documentation, we only have to send the time if MCU requests it. this is
unlike how TUYA_SET_TIME is implementing in xdrv_16, where if
USE_TUYA_TIME is enabled it will send unsolicited time updates every
minute as well as in response to a request from the MCU.

i couldn't find an easy to check flag to see if tasmota was synced to a
real clock, so this blindly tells the MCU that our time is valid and
copies it over, the same as xdrv_16.

the tuya doco also describes a ""Get system time in GMT"" request and
response structure which would be mostly a copy of this code if i knew
if and where tasmota keeps track of UTC/GMT.

lastly, i'm not convinced RtcTime.day_of_week is right. it's friday
here which should be 6 if you start counting sunday as 1, but i read 2

* local time sync is implemented, but not gmtime",13,72,1,0

## Description:

by using the 4MB default safeboot partition scheme layout. Tasmota will increase the FS partition with
the new Autoresize feature introduced with PR #16838 #16842

So it is possible to reduce the boards mainifest since it is no more needed to have different ones for boards with different flash sizes. Added generic S3 Flash / PSRAM boards variants. Removed all S3 boards specific variants. Configuration is done via Autoconfig. For a few special use cases maybe an [env] needs to be defined. Examples for are in file `platformio_tasmota_cenv_sample.ini`

@s-hadinger @arendst @staars please test. Since it is a major change how the firmwares are build, there is maybe something i overlooked. So i do not check all below.

Created by myself initially in LUA running as a Domoticz (running on a raspberry pi) script and controlling Qubino relays for floor heating. Ported to tasmota to get the logic within the relay itself and be less dependent on Domoticz.

The controller supports several working modes. From off (no action) to manual (following input), automatic (hybrid, rampup or pi controller) and timeplan (automatic following predefined schedule with 3 temperatures for each weekday). It is fully configured via commands, it will include in the future diagnostics and will be extended to more outputs (will be tested on sonoff 4CH Pro).

The controller has been tested successfully with a Shelly 1PM device and works as the original LUA domoticz script.",38,39,0,0

Added NAV-VELNED messages to driver, allowing speed and heading info on the main web page and JSON messages. Probably could be optimized; mostly another exercise in copy/paste

* wrap velocity code in #define USE_GPS_VELOCITY

Code space increases by 0k4, not sure about RAM (don't know how to measure). But added a struct with 320 bits, so maybe 40 bytes?

* Add new xdrv_05_ds18x20.ino free from library OneWire and add the
following features:
 *  Add support for DS1822
 *  Add forced setting of
12-bit resolution for selected device types (#1222)
 *  Add read
temperature retry counter (#1215)
 *  Fix lost sensors by performing
sensor probe at restart only thereby removing dynamic sensor probe
(#1215)
 *  Fix sensor address sorting using ascending sort on sensor
type followed by sensor address
 *  Rewrite JSON resulting in shorter
message allowing more sensors in default firmware image:

sensor (USE_DS18X20_LEGACY)
 * Add support for Sonoff Dual R2 (#1249)

The major features of IF statement are:
 - Support IF, ELSEIF, ELSE
 - Support not only comparison but also using logical expression as condition
 - Support run multiple commands
 - Support nested IF statement
 - All the commands run by IF statement will go to the BACKLOG!
 - No limit for logical operators, parenthesis and nested IF statement. Depends on your RAM!

Extended Backus-Naur Form of IF statement:
<if-statement> ::=
IF ""("" <logical-expression> "")"" <statement-list> {ELSEIF ""("" <logical-expression> "")"" <statement-list>} [ELSE <statement-list>] ENDIF
<logical-expression> :=
<comparison-expression> |
(<comparison-expression> | <logical-expression>) {(AND | OR) <logical-expression>} |
""("" <logical-expression "")"" {(AND | OR) <logical expression>}
<comparison-expression> ::=
<math-expression> (""="" | ""<"" | "">"" | ""|"" | ""=="" | ""<="" | "">="" | ""!="") <math-expression>
<statement-list> ::=
<statement> {"";"" <statement>}
<statement> ::=
<Sonoff-Tasmota-command> | <if-statement>

In English:
If statement support 3 format:
1. IF (<condition>) <statement-list> ENDIF
2. IF (<condition>) <statement-list> ELSE <statement-list> ENDIF
3. IF (<condition>) <statement-list> [ELSEIF (<condition>) <statement-list> ]* ELSE <statement-list> ENDIF

<condition> is a logical expression which can be:
1. A comparison expression for example:
   VAR1 >= 10
2. Multiple comparison expression with logical operator ""AND"" or ""OR"" between them. ""AND"" has higher priority than ""OR"". Fox example:
   UPTIME > 100 AND MEM1 == 1 OR MEM2 == 1
3. Parenthesis can be used to change the priority of logical expression. For example:
   UPTIME > 100 AND (MEM1 == 1 OR MEM2 == 1)

<statement-list> can be:
1. A Sonoff-Tasmota command. For example:
   ledpower on
2. A IF statement (""IF .... ENDIF"")
3. Multiple Sonoff-Tasmota command or IF statement split with "";"". For example:
   Power1 off; Ledpower on; if (mem1 == 0) Var1 Var1+1; mem1==1 endif; Delay 10; POWER1 on
4. Do not need to lead with ""BACKLOG"" for multiple commands.",28,31,0,0

Output of decode-status.py lacks information about the latest two new sets of feature bits, due to the constant for array size not being updated when the array was expanded. Code changed to avoid this magical number, but instead check size of array with texts, and array with features from the JSON format in Status 4, using the lowest number to provide as many bits as both Tasmota version and Python code supports. A warning is printed if the number of feature bits from Tasmota is higher than supported in the current iteration of Python code.

* Worked on ESP32 dimmer with Zero cross

Until now the ESP32 does not support zero-cross dimmer. I take a sneak how they did in in ESPhome and adapted the approach to TASMOTA. At the end it works that smooth that likely i will change ESP8266 either so we have a common code. Currently ESP8266 is not touched.
There is a minor issue with savedata == default. When changing the dimmer value the interrupts get stopped during write of the config data to flash.

* ESP8266 Dimmer added

Worked all so well and the code is much smaller. There is no need for reconfiguration on existing users. But there are settings not needed anymore. Will work on the documentation. Anyhow existing installations can upgrade without hickup

* Optimized endpoints at dimmer 0 and 100

* Removed debug stuff

* Fix Issue at dimmer = 0

* Small bugfix

* Final checked Version

* Update xsns_01_counter.ino

* Add missing func

* Update xsns_01_counter.ino

* Moved out of the house of counter and build my own one

* New ZeroCross Driver

* Update xdrv_91_zerocrossDimmer.ino

* evolving

* Delete xdrv_91_zerocrossDimmer.ino

* Add files via upload

* Changed drv number from 1 to 68

The ""memory fragmentation"" value named ""memory_ratio"" was always
truncated to an integer, so in all likelyhood 0. It didn't work anyway
until the incorrect line termination was fixed in an earlier commit.
Neither could the Psram metric be parsed correctly due to the the same
incorrect line termination.

With this change memory usage is reported in line with Prometheus'
upstream recommendations (https://prometheus.io/docs/practices/naming/).
Labels are no longer used to separate distinct dimensions. Total and
free memory as well as the maximum allocation size are reported as
separate metrics where available while labels are used to differenciate
the separate kinds of memory (heap on all, psram on ESP32).

Label values are now also lowercase on ESP32 to match ESP8266.

Metrics should report their base values, not the result of
a calculation. Therefore the already non-working ""fragmentation"" metric
is dropped. It can easily be calculated in PromQL instead.

The renaming of metrics and label values makes this a breaking change,
especially on ESP32. With the aforementioned formatting errors which
made them unusable that shouldn't be a problem.

It is not practical to send long streams of data using the existing IRSend RAW command as it is limited by the size of the mqtt buffer.

The format for this command is:
        IRSend raw,<freq>,<hdr_mrk>,<hdr_spc>,<bit_mrk>,<zer_spc>,<one_spc>,<bit_str>
where,
        <freq>    = carrier freq (default 0, 38kHz)
        <hdr_mrk> = header mark (ms)
        <hdr_spc> = header space (ms)
        <bit_mrk> = bit mark (ms)
        <zer_spc> = zero space (ms)
        <one_spc> = one space (ms)
        <bit_str> = bit stream data (stream of ones and zeroes)

The problem was fixed in version 1.9.0.
Currently, this library is required and used just by the
Adafruit_VEML7700 library.
The VEML7700 sensor has been tested and proved to correctly work.

Before we used the ""working period"" method (the sensor starts/stops periodically on it's own and reports the data if Tasmota asks for values). Because of that I've detected a drift after some time which means that you don't get current values if ""tele_period"" is reached. Another point was that the ""working period"" method only allows a frequency above 1 minute. The new code starts the sensor directly (with commands sleep and work) if we reached a time we set in define ""STARTING_OFFSET"". 5 seconds before tele_period, we are doing 4 measurements, calculate the average and current values are present if tele_period is reached. The new method allows us also to get a polling frequency below 1 minute (usable for early fire detection). For precise measurements values of STARTING_OFFSET above 30 seconds are recommended. If using STARTING_OFFSET of 30 seconds and tele_period of 30 seconds the sensor now runs permanent.

Output of decode-status.py lacks information about the latest two new sets of feature bits, due to the constant for array size not being updated when the array was expanded. Code changed to avoid this magical number, but instead check size of array with texts, and array with features from the JSON format in Status 4, using the lowest number to provide as many bits as both Tasmota version and Python code supports. A warning is printed if the number of feature bits from Tasmota is higher than supported in the current iteration of Python code.

Format strings for Prometheus metrics were written manually and the
`# TYPE` lines needed to be kept in sync with actual metrics. As
indicated by the previous commit it wasn't always as consistent as
desired. In addition there was a lot of repetition among the strings
which couldn't be reduced at build time.

With this change utility functions are introduced which eliminate the
need for specifying the same metric name more than once. At the same
time the proper escaping for label values, initially added in commit
16b5f2fe9, is now applied for all labels.

The size of the program shrinks slightly by 212 bytes on ESP8266 in the
""tasmota"" configuration with Prometheus enabled and 412 bytes on ESP32
with the ""tasmota32"" configuration.

Not all flag names were updated to match updates to Tasmota source in `support_features.ino`. I assume the changes to be uncontroversial, with the possible exception of:

While `USE_TUYA_DIMMER` arguably is a more descriptive name than `USE_TUYA_MCU` the former name is not found anywhere in Tasmota code, which has 
```
#if defined(USE_LIGHT) && defined(USE_TUYA_MCU)
    feature2 |= 0x00008000;  // xdrv_16_tuyadimmer.ino
#endif
```
My assumption is that the actually used names ""wins"", to avoid user confusion, even if you could say that the name `USE_TUYA_MCU` is too broad for the actual feature. In principle, it would be more logical to create a new ""real"" `#define` name, but backwards compatibility and all that.... Makes sense?

The HPMA115C0-xxx is a new series of devices than has a
slightly different (longer) response than the HPMA115S0-xxx

THis patch keeps the same API as the original library and
picks out the PM2.5 and PM10 reading from the new response
format.

The patch also changes a const change to be more in line with
the upstream library for future rebases.

This change has also been merge-requested into the upstream
library.

Hi all,
now that it's in the world I found the implementation of my A4988 - module not good concerning usability.

I use ioBroker as Backend and the device reports there as expected with a Property named ""MOTOR"" but no reasonable way to pass the commands to it.
Iv'e forked Tasmota again and changed the xdrv_25_A4988_Stepper.ino.
I expose the commands directly and changed the names so they can be found close together in the propertylist.
New CommandNames: 
motorMove
motorRotate
motorTurn
motorMIS
motorSPR
motorRPM
if you pull it, I instantly would change the wiki.",31,31,0,0

Added new triggers for rules: `VARx#STATE` and `MEMx#STATE`

These new triggers allows to execute commands when VARs or MEMs change their values.

This is useful for automations where the parameter sent to Tasmota by MQTT is a SetPoint for example.

Before these triggers, the approach was using an `EVENT` to store a value but some components in home automation softwares can't use `cmnd/sonofftopic/EVENT SETVAR=25`, where `cmnd/sonofftopic/EVENT` is the mqtt message and `SETVAR=25` is the payload.

With this new triggers, it will be as simple as `cmnd/sonofftopic/VAR 25` so any automation software can use it.

_(Using `cmnd/sonofftopic/EVENT SETVAR=` as mqtt message and `25` as payload is not understood by Tasmota)_",18,23,0,1

* When setting PWM values, updates all the LEDs (instant response). Uses led_power values.
* If LEDLINK not set, but LED1 is, LED1 is the status led. When turning on/off, setledlink uses digitalwrite (which does not respect the new pwm operation). In this case only, we will use the setledpoweridx instead of digitalwrite - costly (every 250ms this runs), but edge case / legacy. Allows more intuitive operation - if we blink an LED with the max and min PWM limits, we'd expect it to respect these. In this case, blink will also now update the led_power status, which keeps this accurate e.g. if ledpower 1 cmnd was sent, then blink occurred, led_state would read a 1 for that bit but the led would be off (but nothing was reading it for status so it didn't cause any trouble). Leaving digitalwrite when LEDLINK is defined as this is more efficient and the use case for pwm leds is to find buttons - link indicator would become more ambiguous for no benefit.",38,40,0,0

Since now the value are mV and not ADC numbers, the fast solution is to revert it back to ADC numbers:

Leaner syntax of function `mp` and simplified implementation.
New documentation:
Mapping function `mp`

It addresses a standard task with less code and much flexibility: mapping an arbitrary incoming numeric value into a defined schema of allowed/reasonable ranges.
The numeric value `x` passed as the first parameter is compared to the mprules in the order they are provided as subsequent parameters. If the value matches the criteria, the defined value is returned. Subsequent mprules are skipped. If `x` matches none of the mprules, `x` is returned unchanged. 
```
mp(x mprule1 mprule2 ... mprule<n>)
```

An mprule starts with one of the comparison operators `<`, `>` or `=`, followed by a numeric value `v1`, optionally followed by a second numeric value `v2`:
```
<|>|=v1[ v2]
```

Example 1: `<8 0` - this rule reads: If x is less than 8, return 0.
Example 2: `>100` - this rule reads: If x is greater than 100, return 100. 

Example 3:
```
y=mp(x <8 0 >100)
```
Assigns 0 to y if x is less than 8.
Assigns 100 to y if x is greater than 100.
Assigns x to y for all values of x that do not meet the above criteria (8 to 100).

The above code of example 3 does the same as the following code - with just one line of code and 19 characters less:
```
y=x
if x<8 {
y=0
}
if x>100 {
y=100
}
```

Every of the above mentioned numeric values `x`, `v1` and `v2` can be a literal, an expression or a variable.",22,37,0,0

Changing default for DisplayMode from 1 to 0. Users are getting confused by the display doing something they did not ask for (and not being aware of DisplayMode). This got worse with LVGL/HASPmota displays becoming common, with users having much less reason to dive into the old DisplayXxxxx commands. And it may even be hard to see that it is even a display of time/date causing the display to flicker.

Changing default for DisplayDimmer from 10% to 50%. The low brightness of 10% is not always easy to see, especially in daylight. 50% is generally better, while not going ""full blast"" with 100%.",6,78,1,0

This fix makes Alexa to works compiling Tasmota under core 2.3.0, 2.4.0, 2.4.1, 2.4.2, 2.5.0 (stage), 2.6.0 (planned)

As the amount of users in the community has grown, also the rate of issues that are opened every month have grown. This led to an increase of issues left behind (not closed by its author no matter if it is answered or solved) making collaborators to spend more time on searching for those between the opened issues. The actual rate of the Bot is 60 days to close an issue that has been left behind (45 days to raise attention to that issue and then other more 15 days to close it), and as the amount of opened issues are around 250-300 each month, in 60 days the amount of issues can raise to about 600 opened issues if no action is taken by collaborators.

With this update to the BOT, the new rate will be 25 days to raise the attention to the issue, and if there is no one comment on that issue, the Bot will close it after 5 more days. This 30 days are more suited to the actual speed of the project.

As always the Bot will not close any issue labeled as 
  - pinned
  - security
  - enhancement
  - bug
And also, if the issue is closed by the Bot, it can be reopened again.

Also this update expands the Bot activity to PRs, so PRs should be labeled as well as issues.",48,25,0,1

* WIP Tuya MCU Bridge driver alternative to the TuyaMCU driver

The main difference is this driver does not try and wire MCU data points
(Dps) into the tasmota power/light/etc controls. Instead each Dp ends up
being relayed directly to MQTT and the rules subsystem. If you want to
change the state of something wired up to the MCU, you send tuyamcu
specific commands to manipulate the Dp.

Each Dp gets a type and id specific topic that is sent to MQTT. eg, Dp
id 1 type bool looks like tele/%topic%/TUYAMCUBOOL1. To change state you
send a TuyaMCUBool1 command (ie, the command index value is used as the
DpId, which is nice and symmetrical) with the new value.

Currently Rules operate on TuyaMCU#TypeDpid things, eg, ""rule1 on
TuyaMCU#Bool1 do power %value% endon"" toggle the power on the tasmota
device when the state of the thing on the MCU changes too.

The most obviously missing stuff at the moment is:

- better relaying of the wifi/mqtt status to the MCU
- handling wifi reset requests from the MCU
- low power stuff?
- support for sending status updates and device info queries.
- restarting the tuya mcu state machine?
- restarting the rx state machine when no bytes are rxed for a period of
  time
- time sync

* shorten the log prefix to TYB (3 chars).

requested by arendst

* use the local definition for the SET_DP command.

reaching back to the existing tuyamcu code isnt reliable.

pointed out by arendst

* put the todo list in the code so it can be tracked

* check the wifi/mqtt state every second and update the mcu if it changes.

* fix rule processing when Dp state is changed from a cmnd.

rule processing was done as part of publishing the state, but publishing
the state when it was updated by a command only happened if So59 was
set. split rule processing out of publish and call them separately as
needed.

publish is now called from teleperiod, status updates from the MCU,
and from cmnds if so59 is set. rules are called from status updates from
the MCU and from cmnds.

Added mapping function `mp`
´´´
mp(x str1 str2 ... str<n>)
´´´
It addresses a standard task with less code and much flexibility: mapping an arbitrary incoming numeric value into the allowed range.
The numeric value `x` passed as the first parameter is compared to the rules in the order they are provided as subsequent sting parameters. If the value matches the criteria, the defined value is returned. Subsequent rules are skipped. If `x` matches none of the rules, `x` is returned unchanged. 

Rules consist of one of the comparison operators `< > =` followed by a numeric value `v1`, optionally followed by a colon and another numeric value `v2`.
```
<|>|=v1[:v2] 
```
Example 1: `""<8:0""` - this rule reads: If x is less than 8, return 0.
Example 2: `"">100""` - this rule reads: If x is greater than 100, return 100. 

Example 3:
```
y=mp(x ""<8:0"" "">100"")
```
Assigns 0 to y if x is less than 8.
Assigns 100 to y if x is greater than 100.
Assigns x to y for all values of x that do not meet the above criteria (8 to 100).

The above code of example 3 does the same as the following code - with just one line of code and 15 characters less:
```
y=x
if x<8 {
y=0
}
if x>100 {
y=100
}

Working fine with MAX3165 and a PT100 probe.

Using a modified version of Adafruit MAX31865 library. Added a default
constructor in order to allow lazy initialization once GPIO definitions
were loaded.

Tested on a Sonoff TH PCB Board 2.1 2018-06-15 using the following GPIO
mapping:

GPIO	Orig Func	SSPI	I/O	HEADER	HEADER2	S-JACK
 15	BOOT MODE 	CLK	   O	           1
 14	            MISO	 I		         2	   TIP
  4		          MOSI   O		         3	   RING1
VCC				                1 VCC	     4	   RING3
  2	DBG BOOT 	  ~CS	   O	5 EXP-LOG
GND				                4 GND		         RING2

HEADER2 is a 4-pin .1 header glued in the middle of the PCB to connect
to several GPIO locations on the Sonoff TH PCB.

* IR: Added support for new A/C protocol fields

New fields introduced in IRremoteESP8266 v2.8.5:
1. Command (one of: [Control | Config | iFeel | Timer], default: Control) - allows to set IR command type (e.g. iFeel for no-beep ambient sensor report)
2. iFeel (boolean, default: false) - configures whether iFeel (ambient sensor temp. is used by the A/C unit)
3. SensorTemp - the ambient sensor temperature reading to send

Note:
 - Fan setting via int is now 6-value (breaking change -> 6 is the new max)

* IR A/C: Model now pretty-printed to JSON

Model string is the default (falls back to int if n/a)

* IR A/C: Added separate JSON resp. per command type

* No change for ""kControlCommand"" (default/legacy).
* SensorReport/Timer/Config commands only contain relevant JSON nodes

Additionally:
 Clock has time semantics (input: minutes, output: HH:MM), except for ""config"" mode,
 where state.clock is used as ConfigKey and state.sleep is used as ConfigValue.

i have a tuyamcu based device that occasionally gets a flipped bit in

bytes that just arent going to arrive, so we don't get to the cksum
field for that test to fail. instead, add a timeout that the tick
checks, and reset the recv state machine on a timeout.

This change will allow mqtt messages simpler by allowing something like
`publish cmnd/ir-bridge/IRHVAC {""Power"": ""On""}`.
The simpler format is required for working with mqtt clients like
iotMQTTPanel or similar on android.

Limitations:
- Requires full message be sent at-least once. I work around this with
   a `system#boot` rule
- Gets messy with multiple devices. I have only one AC per room, and
  this doesn't doesn't interfere with other IR devices.

TODO:
- [ ] Change the build flag `INCREMENTAL_IRAC`to a `SetOption`
- [ ] Persist `irac_prev_state` across reboots.
- [ ] Support multiple devices.",9,76,1,0
