another issue: only the achievement author was eligible for it. As a

In order for the new site award reordering to work the 20190702_Add_DisplayOrder_to_SiteAwards.sql must be run to add the new DisplayOrder field to the SiteAwards table in the database. By default it will give all awards a DisplayOrder of 0 until the user goes in and changes them.

This is my attempt to modify the game page by increasing the game Icon size, increasing the indent after icon, and adding the game info under the title to make use of the empty space.

The intent is for the game pages to look like this: https://i.imgur.com/J1G46hY.png

We're already running PHP 8.2 and Ubuntu 22.04 on the server.
This update reflect those changes in the application.
To be able to upgrade to Laravel 10 and use Enums we need 8.1+.
8.0 will be EOL (end of life) in two months.

Note: composer update to pull in PHP 8.2 dependencies will follow in a
separate PR because it will require some changes.

Please update your local environment:
- Ubuntu 20.04 in VM: dist upgrade
- XAMPP/LAMPP/WAMPP: re-install/update
- Docker: `sail up`
- Valet: `valet use 8.2` or `valet isolate php@8.2`

The replacement of twitch links with the embedded twitch player seemed to assume
that the text it operated on only contained the twitch link and nothing else. It
also assumed that if 'twitch.tv' was present in the text, the rest of the text
was a properly formed twitch link.

Fixed using a regex-based solution that can handle multiple twitch links and
does not mess with the rest of the text.

-----

A second problem was that twitch, youtube & imgur links were being embedded even
when they were introduced by the expansion of tags such as [user=x]. This caused
problems if a user had a twitch link in their motto, for example.

Fixed by embedding the links before expanding forum-specific tags, thus acting
only on the links present in the actual forum post.",150,20,0,0

This feature add several different ways of filter tickets on the Ticket Manager page. Each filter can be individually toggled which allows for a good amount of custom filtering. Total open tickets and total filtered tickets will always display in the headers on the page.

The filters are broken into the following categories:

Ticket State - The state of the ticket
 * Open
 * Closed
 * Resolved

Report Type - Why is this ticket being written
 * Triggered at wrong time
 * Doesn't Trigger

MD5 - Does the ticket include a MD5
 * Contains MD5 - (e.g. 'MD5: e9b45d6455e0753b8e0e825a36458253')
 * MD5 Unknown - (e.g. 'MD5: Unknown' or 'MD5:' is not in the notes at all)

Emulator - Does the ticket specify an emulator
 * RA Emulator - (e.g. 'Emulator: RANES')
 * RetroArch - Defined - (e.g. 'Emulator: RetroArch (Mupen64Plus-Next OpenGL)')
 * RetroArch - Undefined - (e.g. 'Emulator: RetroArch ()')
