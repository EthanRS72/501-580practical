## **Description**

Allow dapp developers to create sequences of RPC method calls that are
sent simultaneously and managed by the MM mobile app using the existing
RPC queue.

Chained RPC Calls:

Implement the ability for the SDK to handle sequences of RPC method
calls.
Address known issues in the RPC queue, especially when one of the
methods fails.

## **Related issues**

[Fixes: sdk 391
](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-sdk/issues/391)

## **Manual testing steps**

1. Use a dapp using metamask/sdk and call the following:
```
    const selectedAddress = provider?.selectedAddress;

    const rpcs: ChainRPC[] = [{
      method: ""personal_sign"",
      params: [""something to sign 1"", selectedAddress],
    },
    {
      method: ""personal_sign"",
      params: [""hello world"", selectedAddress],
    },
    {
      method: ""personal_sign"",
      params: [""Another one #3"", selectedAddress],
    }];

    try {
      const response = await provider?.request({method: 'metamask_batch', params: rpcs}) as any[];
      ...
```

<!--
Thanks for your contribution!

Please ensure that any applicable requirements below are satisfied
before submitting this pull request. This will help ensure a quick and
efficient review cycle.
-->

**Development & PR Process**
1. Follow MetaMask [Mobile Coding
Standards](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/blob/main/.github/coding_guidelines/CODING_GUIDELINES.md)
2. Add `release-xx` label to identify the PR slated for a upcoming
release (will be used in release discussion)
3. Add `needs-dev-review` label when work is completed
4. Add the appropiate QA label when dev review is completed
    - `needs-qa`: PR requires manual QA.
- `No QA/E2E only`: PR does not require any manual QA effort. Prior to
merging, ensure that you have successful end-to-end test runs in
Bitrise.
- `Spot check on release build`: PR does not require feature QA but
needs non-automated verification. In the description section, provide
test scenarios. Add screenshots, and or recordings of what was tested.
5. Add `QA Passed` label when QA has signed off (Only required if the PR
was labeled with `needs-qa`)
6. Add your team's label, i.e. label starting with `team-` (or
`external-contributor` label if your not a MetaMask employee)

**Description**

The `AddressBookController` stores addresses by chain ID, but we had
been storing and retrieving them using the network ID instead in many
places. It has been updated to consistently use the chain ID for all
address book access.

Existing address book entries have been migrated to be grouped by chain
ID. For all known networks, we attempt to map the network ID to a chain
ID that exists as a locally configured or built-in network. In cases
where multiple matches are found, the entries are duplicated on each
matching chain. Address book entries that don't correspond with any
local networks are discarded.

**Screenshots / Recordings**

### Before

In this recording, I create a contact on ETC and show that it's also
suggested on Ethereum Mainnet

https://recordit.co/KrZMjEYKb4

### After

In this recording, I am running a test build on this branch with the
same wallet state as for the ""Before"" recording, so the test ETC contact
entry is still there. I show that it was duplicated onto both Ethereum
Mainnet and ETC. Then I create a new contact entry and show that it's
correctly saved just for the current chain.

The remaining non-static methods from `web3-provider-engine` have been
migrated to `RPCMethodMiddleware.ts` with the rest of the method
handlers. The two methods left were `personal_ecRecover` and
`parity_checkRequest`.

`personal_ecRecover` will recover the signing account from a signature.
This operation requires no private keys. Commonly dapps will do this
themselves. Persumably it was added to the dapp API at some point for
convenience. It has been preserved just to avoid making breaking
changes to the dapp API.

`parity_checkRequest` would return the result of a parity signature or
transaction. It returned `null` if none were found. The parity
signature and request methods have been throwing an error for some time
now, so there is never any result to check. As a result, this method
has been returning `null` for all requests in practice. It has been
preserved just to avoid making breaking changes to the dapp API.

## **Description**
1. **What is the reason for the change?**
* Sentry PollingBlockTracker errors were very noisy (see related issue)
2. **What is the improvement/solution?**
* Silencing the unhandled error as we weren't able to determine sources
of errors
  * Patch the web3-provider-engine node module with change
* The PollingBlockTracker will be replaced in the network-controller v9
- which is expected to be released soon

## **Related issues**

Fixes: #7579 

## **Manual testing steps**

1. Switch between networks
2. Swap some crypto

## **Description**
Our automated tests are launching the app multiple times at the start of
the tests. To improve performance and stability of tests the tests
should only launch the app once at the beginning of tests.

Didn't remove `init.js` because there is an error that occurs when
running tests without `init.js`.

## **Related issues**

Fixes: #https://github.com/MetaMask/mobile-planning/issues/1348

## **Manual testing steps**

1. Go to this page...
2.
3.

## **Screenshots/Recordings**

<!-- If applicable, add screenshots and/or recordings to visualize the
before and after of your change. -->

### **Before**
App would launch twice at the start of tests.

### **After**
App launches only once at the start of tests.

**Description**

This PR updates our metric scheme to capture the adoption blockaid
security feature so we're able confidently iterate over and improve this
feature.

**Task**

- [x] Create a new user profile property called `security_providers`.
This property should be a type string property
- [x] This property should receive the value `blockaid` if the user has
enabled the under Settings > Experimental.
- [x] If the user turns off the transactions security provider feature
under Settings > Experimental, the user profile property
`security_provider` should be updated to remove the `blockaid` value
from it.
- [x] Whenever the user enables or disables this feature, we should also
trigger a new event named `Settings Updated` with a property
`security_alerts_enabled` with the value `true` if the user has enabled
it or with the value `false` if user has disabled it.

**Issue**

Fixes: #6760

## **Description**
When approving a token and you click on `Verify third party details` it
adds the token to the wallet. This PR prevents calling `addToken` on the
token approve screen.

## **Manual testing steps**
1. Go to the test dapp
2. Deploy an ERC721/ERC20 token
3. Click Approve
4. Click Verify Third party details
5. Cancel
6. Go to the Home wallet
7. You shouldn't see a new token added to your wallet.

## **Description**

The purpose of this PR is to set up the regression test pipeline in
Bitrise. Currently, we conduct regression tests on our local machines,
which has its limitations. An improved approach involves running these
tests on a virtual machine, which offers more flexibility and
scalability.

The regression pipeline in bitrise is called: `pr_regression_e2e_tests`

Also, I removed all flaky/failing tests from the regression tag and
placed them in a quarantine folder.

## **Description**

Whenever I trigger a legacy transaction from a dapp, I can see how the
Estimated gas fees does not match the gas details (if I open the Edit
gas). Furthermore if I change the suggested gas, I can see how the value
is not changed and tx is submitted with the suggested gas value instead
of the one I set. [See
here](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/pull/7035#issuecomment-1717118939)

## **Manual testing steps**
Test for both 1559 supported network and legacy network. For legacy
network, use ganache and check that `--hardfork berlin` or use Palm. For
1559, a testnet like Georli should suffice

Setup legacy network using 
_1. Step1:_ Setup wallet and import the right key and account
_3. Step3:_ Check that transactions are submitted as expected.

* Refactor RPC `getAccounts` usage

The `getAccounts` function is defined and used in two different places
in the RPC pipeline: `RPCMethodMiddleware.ts` and
`web3-provider-engine`. The second one has been removed, so now all
usage is in `RPCMethodMiddleware.ts`.

`getAccounts` is passed into `web3-provider-engine` and used in the
`HookedWalletSubprovider`: https://github.com/MetaMask/web3-provider-engine/blob/cf612f898002833c36730d23972fe4c4dd483c76/subproviders/hooked-wallet.js

It is used in these methods:
* `eth_coinbase`
* `eth_accounts`
* `parity_defaultAccount`

It's also called to validate the sender, for the following methods:
* `eth_signTypedData`
* `eth_signTypedData_v3`
* `eth_signTypedData_v4`
* `encryption_public_key`
* `eth_decryptMessage`
* `personal_sign`
* `eth_sign`
* `eth_signTransaction`
* `eth_sendTransaction`

Of these methods, most of them are intercepted in
`RPCMethodMiddleware.ts`, so the requests never make it to
`web3-provider-engine`.

These three methods will make their way there: `parity_defaultAccount`,
`encryption_public_key`, and `eth_decryptMessage`. The decryption-
related messages rely on constructor parameters that mobile does not
pass in, so those always throw an error. The only method this hook is
used for in practice is `parity_defaultAccount`.

The `parity_defaultAccount` method was added to
`RPCMethodMiddleware.ts, so now that method won't make it to
`web3-provider-engine` either. Functionally it is the same as
`eth_coinbase`, so the same implementation has been used.

The Engine class is riddled with type errors, which has been making the
controller updates difficult. In attempting to address these errors,
one of the first obstacles was the conditional constructor. The types
for the class would be a lot simpler if we could assume that certain
properties were always initialized, but the condition prevents that.

The condition was meant to ensure that only one global Engine instance
was ever constructed. This check has been moved to the `init` function
at the end of the file instead. This has the same effect, as that
function is the only place the Engine class is constructed (it's not
exported). This is much easier for TypeScript to understand.

* fix: Fix crash when switching to Linea

A recent `@metamask/controller-utils` update in #6874 caused the app
to crash when switching to Linea because it removed the resolution for
this package. Without that resolution, multiple copies of the package
were introduced, but the Linea patch was only applied to one of them.
The network controller was using a copy without the patch applied,
resulting in the crash.

This was resolved by restoring the resolution. We can remove it again
once we have deleted the patch.

* Update controller-utils patch to restore constants

The constants `MAINNET` and `TESTNET_TICKER_SYMBOLS` were removed in
v3.1.0, which was accidentally omitted from the changelog and not
considered in the release version (this should have been a breaking
change).

They have been restored until we no longer rely on packages that use
`@metamask/controller-utils` at versions under v3.1.0.",155,60,1,0

## **Description**
Update `fetch-depth` parameter to fetch only the last commit, rather
than the whole commit history

We used to fetch the whole commit history which wasn't useful for this
github action. This change allows to fetch only the latest commit which
makes the workflow more efficient. This improvement is not a game
changer, but it's worth doing it as the workflow runs quite often
(multiple times for every PR), as it's triggered every time PR labels
are updated.

Same [PR](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-extension/pull/21119) for
Extension.

## **Manual testing steps**

1. Add a team label on this PR, the job shall turn to green
2. Remove team label from this PR, the job shall turn to red

The CurrencyRateController has been migrated to the BaseControllerV2

rather than via a `subscribe` function.
* The state and configuration are passed in as one ""options"" object,
rather than as two separate parameters

be stopped and started on-demand now as well.

The Redux store module and the root reducer have been migrated to
TypeScript. We now have the start of a root state object for the Redux
state. Most of the reducers still aren't typed, or there are type
errors, but it's a start. The missing pieces are typed as `any` for
now.

The TypeScript conversion introduced some lint errors caused by the
pattern of using destructuring to omit object properties. The rule has
been updated to allow this pattern (it's already allowed on the latest
shared ESLint config).

The store type changes required updates to the selectors as well. The
types they had been using only included a subset of the root state.
They have been updated to use the real root state type instead.

* Refactor `eth_sendTransaction` method handler

The method handler for `eth_sendTransaction` has been moved to a
separate module to simplify unit testing. Unit tests have been added
as well.

This module was written in TypeScript, which asked for some additional
validation of the method parameters. We now throw a more explicit
message when the params are missing, and when the transaction
parameters are not an object. Previously the method would still throw
an error in these scenarios, just with a less helpful message. The
change in error message should be the only functional change here.

This refactor is intended to make testing PR #5619 easier.

* Support `.cjs` file extensions

The Metro configuration has been updated to support `.cjs` file
extensions. The `@metamask/utils` dependency relies upon the library
`superstruct` which uses `.cjs` for its main exported module.",393,56,1,0

in practice these components were only using the provider config.

**Description**
We need to allow MetaMask users and developers to report false
positives.

Following the guidelines
[here](https://www.figma.com/file/Q69vHaA7Or7Rxz4vdzjVHC/Support-for-tx-security-providers-(MVP)?type=design&node-id=6065-12121&mode=design&t=KNanPwmcsjTor5Ej-0),
we add a link to when clicked opens the MetaMask support page

Tasks

- [x] Add an option on the UI to report a false positive (see design).
Clicking on the link should direct the users to customer support (link:
https://support.metamask.io/hc/en-us - the link might change to an
specific one for this feature)
- [x] Add new property to transactions and signatures events named
external_link_clicked and pass the value security_alert_support_link to
it whenever the user clicks on the above link within the warning.

## **Description**
Our E2E tests started to fail once
https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/pull/7483 was merged. See
bitrise build here:
https://app.bitrise.io/app/be69d4368ee7e86d/pipelines/04f65a4a-413c-4481-a33f-b15b10a67814

The test failure occurred due to tests that were hanging and eventually
timing out. It is crucial to acknowledge that Detox waits for the app to
become idle before proceeding with its execution.

## **Manual testing steps**

_1. Step1:_
_2. Step2:_
_3. ..._

## **Screenshots/Recordings**

_If applicable, add screenshots and/or recordings to visualize the
before and after of your change._

## **Description**
This PR addresses an issue encountered when increasing the number of
workers to 3 in the CI pipeline. The problem arose because, when
increasing the number of jest workers, Detox creates new emulators in
the same VM. However, existing fixtures, Ganache, and the test Dapp were
not equipped to dynamically manage port allocation, causing test
failures due to port conflicts between workers. These failures were
particularly noticeable in confirmation tests, as they utilised Ganache,
the test Dapp, and different fixtures for each test.

To resolve this issue, this PR introduces a dynamic port allocation
mechanism that is deterministic and relies on `process.pid` instead of
`JEST_WORKER_ID` because the worker id is different in the emulator but
always `1` outside where servers are spun up. This approach ensures that
the number of ports is different between the workers, eliminating port
clashes and enabling smooth test execution in multi-worker environments.",61,62,1,0

* refactor: Use selectors for core network state access

Replace direct references to NetworkController state with selectors.
Most of these examples were skipped in previous selector refactors
because they were outside of a React context, so there was no
established way to get the Redux state as input for the selector. We
can now do that by importing the Redux store directly and calling
`getState`.

This relates to https://github.com/MetaMask/mobile-planning/issues/1226

* Update WalletConnect to pass full state to selector

The WalletConnect module has been updated to pass the full Redux state
to the `selectChainId` selector, rather than just the background state.
The background state was being passed in alone because it was left
behind accidentally from an earlier version of this branch, from before
the recent store refactors/TypeScript conversion.",119,62,1,0

**Description**

Extended the session persistence time to one hour without showing OTP.

For the first hour after connecting, the session will remain active
without requesting an OTP.

All of the examples SDK apps that use the OTP modal tested on IOS and
Android with a new wallet build that includes the new OTP changes.

The cases that have been checked were `when the channel was active
recently` and `when the channel was NOT active recently` in order to
test both flows.

Everything appears to be working as expected.

The Jest configuration used for Detox e2e tests has been updated to use
a Node.js environment rather than React Native presets. This was a
requirement for using Ganache as part of e2e tests (it was incompatible
with some of the global changes introduced by the React Native
environment).

The Jest process doesn't need to execute any React Native code directly
as part of the e2e test suite. The only direct reference today was via
the `i18n` module, which was accessed to retrieve localized messages.
All such references were updated to use the JSON file directly, to
avoid importing React Native libraries.

Progresses https://github.com/MetaMask/mobile-planning/issues/765

* Migrate test IDs to `app/constants/test-ids.js`

Various test IDs were being stored in ""constants"" files that assumed a
React Native conext. Specifically, they were using `require` to
""import"" static files. This throws an error in a Node.js context.

These test IDs have been migrated to `app/constants.test-ids.js` to
avoid importing any React Native modules from the e2e test runner
process.",390,57,1,0

The controller packages have been updated to use the latest versions of
each package. The only breaking change that affects mobile was the
rename of the `provider` property of the network controller to
`providerConfig`. Most changes in this commit relate to that change.

* Add Bitrise caching

Caching has been added to our Bitrise CI config. It uses the legacy
branch caching API [1] because our current plan does not support the
newer key-based caching API [2].

Typically the way caching works on Bitrise is that each step will
have internal steps to ""stage"" data for caching, and the explicit cache
step saves all of this data in the end. However the `yarn` step doesn't
stage things correctly for us for two reasons:
* It only supports caching the `install` command, but we use `setup`
* It caches the `node_modules` directory, but we want to cache the Yarn
cache directory.

Caching `node_modules` could result in a difficult-to-reproduce build
because it could lead to a different directory structure when the build
runs, and it could cache the output of `postinstall` steps that aren't
intended to be run multiple times. However it should be save to cache
the Yarn cache because it doesn't affect hoisting, and doesn't include
any content that gets modified during the install process.

Fixes #5810

## **Description**
It has been observed that in some Android runs, relative to
confirmations, tests were sometimes flaky due to Ganache not terminating
properly.
This was not evident on regular runs as only Smoke tests are run (with 1
test using ganache) but it shines in the case you run all the
Confirmations e2e (more than 1 test using ganache, needing the server to
terminate and start everytime).

([Context](https://consensys.slack.com/archives/C02U025CVU4/p1694462076620829))
This change increase confirmations e2e stability by terminating the
ganache server in the `afterEach` hooks instead of inside the
`withFixtures` method.

## **Manual testing steps**
- Run the tests locally
- Run the tests on Bitrise. Test run here:
https://app.bitrise.io/app/be69d4368ee7e86d/pipelines/12c59c1c-7265-4c9e-aa79-e9af0c867d92

## **Description**
Fixes edge case on android when the connection is recovered after
MetaMask is killed. There was an issue on android creating double
conflicting connections.

This PR prevents the reconnection conflict on android (IOS doesn't have
this issue).

We also added overall logging capabilities to help debug connection
related issue. Logging is non intrusive and can only be enabled when
setting `export SDK_DEV='DEV'` in `.js.env`.

## **Manual testing steps**

_1. Connect on android via deeplink
_2. Sign request
_3. Kill Metamask
_4. Sign again on dapp via deeplink (previously it would generate
warnings and instabilities)

## **Description**
In this PR we are splitting up the Signatures test into different files,
in the same way we have on Extension:
- eth-sign
- personal-sign
- typed-sign

This helps us run test faster since they can run in parallel: ~ **9
minutes faster in Android**

## **Manual testing steps**
- Run tests locally
- Check Bitrise run here

* refactor: Simplify `handleNetworkSwitch` helper (#6878)

The `handleNetworkSwitch` helper function no longer requires the
`frequentRpcList` state as a parameter. Instead it takes a reference to
the `PreferencesController`, and gets the RPC list state from that.

Typically it would be preferrable to reference controller state from
Redux rather than accesing it directly from the Engine global. However,
this function will be called from non-UI contexts, so it has to get
controller state from global context regardless.

This change was done to simplify PR #6872, which is part of
https://github.com/MetaMask/mobile-planning/issues/798

* refactor: Consistent provider config naming (#6880)

The `providerConfig` property of the `NetworkController` used to be
named `provider`, which was very easily confused with the `provider`
instance (and with various other things that we call ""provider""). When
that renaming happened, not all local variables and function names were
updated accordingly.

All references to `providerConfig` now use the term ""providerConfig"".

* refactor: Refactor `isTestNet` to accept chain ID

The `isTestNet` utility function now accepts a chain ID rather than a
network ID. The chain ID is easier for us to access because we know the
chain ID for all networks statically, as it's a required network
configuration property. The network ID on the other hand is looked up
at runtime, and is sometimes not present.

In practice we had already been passing in chain ID as network ID in
many places This hasn't caused issues because they are equivalent for
most (though not all) networks.

* Update controller packages to match core v40

The controller packages have been updated to match the versions in the
core monorepo v40 release. The keyring controller update was held back
due to incompatibilities related to BigInt.

The only breaking change was to the network controller state. The state
property `properties` was renamed to `networkDetails`. Luckily there
was only a single direct reference to this property (in a test) so the
number of changes required was minimal, but we did need a state
migration.

In the send flow, scanning a QR code to fill out the ""to"" field can
also trigger a network switch, which shows an alert to the user.
Elsewhere in the codebase where this alert is shown, the network name
is used in the alert. But here in the send flow, the network ID was
used.

Now the network name is used everywhere. The network name is the name
users are likely to understand; we don't expect users to memorize
or understand network IDs.

Incoming transaction notifications were incorrectly being triggered for
transactions on networks different than the current selected network.
This situation only occurs when a custom network is selected, and when
an incoming transaction is detected on a _different_ custom network.
In all other circumstances, we only show incoming transaction
notifications for the current selected network.

This problem date back to the original implementation of incoming
transaction notifications (see https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/pull/447/files#r261268602)

The filter has been updated to use chain ID rather than network ID,
and to filter in the same way for built-in and custom networks.

Most controller packages have been updated to the versions included in
the core monorepo v42 release. The keyring controller was the only
package held back, due to the BigInt incompatibility.

The breaking change for most of these updates was related to the
removal of the `isomorphic-fetch` package. That package would polyfill
the `fetch` API if it wasn't present. It's not a breaking change for
mobile because mobile already includes its own polyfill for the `fetch`
API.

The only other breaking change is to the gas fee controller, which has
made a constructor parameter required rather than optional. This does
not affect mobile because mobile already sets that parameter..

Hi Team,

We have noticed some mistakes in the ES translation for MM mobile:

 - ""Nonce"" should be translated as ""Nonce"", instead of ""mientras tanto"" (which means ""meanwhile""), as it currently is now. 
- ""Agilizar"" should be replaced with ""Acelerar"", for consistency: everywhere else, ""speed up"" was translated as ""Acelerar""

Thank you!

## **Description**
This PR brings back ganache termination on `withFixtures` after
discovering the root cause for the flaky tests.
Ganache termination was moved to hooks, because it seemed to help reduce
the flaky tests, but now that we've discovered the real root cause of
the problem, ganache termination can be moved back to fixtures, where it
was.


There was [a PR
](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/pull/7216/files) merged a
couple of weeks ago which introduced maxWorkers: 3 on ci. This makes
tests run in parallel but does not parallelize the environment, making
all our servers using the same ports to collision and fail.To confirm
the theory, in this branch I disabled maxWorkers and all Confirmations
tests run successfully.

## **Manual testing steps**

Running all Confirmations test without parallelization.

## **Description**

Problem being solved: prototype pollution/poisoning

SES lockdown (shim v0.18.8) on iOS JSC, baked early into RN core before
RN initialisation for the simplest minimal solution
as opposed to previous approach of shim'ing at the beginning of our
entry file requiring further complex lib patches

with SES lockdown on Android Hermes (introduced earlier in our [RN v0.71.6 upgrade](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/pull/6220))
being followed up separately
currently bundling successfully, but runtime not yet functional

_SES lockdown on Android JSC was also passing smoke tests after some work prior to Hermes_
_so a backup engine worth keeping on ice being followed up separately_ 

_Previous patches no longer required:
[`eth-keyring-controller`](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/pull/3794/files#diff-19aae36749eec9908c74557591fade5cc596e9a40422d88594c0fba456870389),
`ethjs-contract` (one not [two](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/pull/3794/files#diff-1970015453fca9583682c37a44695a3d26645329e586bb70ff6f05b74f936802)), [`web3-core-methods`](https://github.com/LavaMoat/docs/issues/8), [`metro-react-native-babel-preset`](https://github.com/LavaMoat/docs/issues/4), Sentry [config](https://github.com/LavaMoat/docs/issues/6) (see previous PR: https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/pull/3794)_

_Nb: `@babel/plugin-transform-regenerator` removed from
`metro-react-native-babel-preset` since initial investigation_
_Nb: `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` config opt `regenerator: true`
previously caused iOS animated node assertion failures_
_Nb: default `@babel/plugin-transform-runtime` via
`metro-react-native-babel-preset` causes additional 4 SES warnings_

## **Description**

We need to add metrics to help measure and estimate the usage and cost
of Infura by ppom.

This fix uses the `providerRequestsCount` object returned as part of the
securityAlertResponse of transaction object and gets only the keys that
matches the below specified requests.

### Proposal
Add new properties to Transactions and Signature events where which
property will count the number of rpc requests made by ppom to evaluate
that specific transaction or signature.

- [x] `ppom_eth_call_count` - counts the number of eth_call rpc requests
made by ppom to evaluate that transaction or signature
- [x] `ppom_eth_createAccessList_count` - counts the number of eth_call
rpc requests made by ppom to evaluate that transaction or signature
- [x] `ppom_eth_getStorageAt_count` - counts the number of eth_call rpc
requests made by ppom to evaluate that transaction or signature
- [x] `ppom_eth_getCode_count` - counts the number of eth_call rpc
requests made by ppom to evaluate that transaction or signature
- [x] `ppom_eth_getTrasanctionCount_count` - counts the number of
eth_call rpc requests made by ppom to evaluate that transaction or
signature
- [x] `ppom_eth_getBalance_count` - counts the number of eth_call rpc
requests made by ppom to evaluate that transaction or signature
- [x] `ppom_trace_call_count` - counts the number of eth_call rpc
requests made by ppom to evaluate that transaction or signature

## **Testing**
1. Start extension with blockaid enabled
2. Go to test-dapp and initiate a blockaid transaction
3. When blockaid banner is shown, check that the above keys (or some of
it at least) are part of the metrics transaction or signature events

## **Description**

This PR introduces a new Github action, to achieve the following:
1. Check if issue matches an existing issue template
('general-issue.yml' or 'bug-report.yml')
2. Add an `INVALID-ISSUE-TEMPLATE` label in case issue doesn't match any
of the templates
3. Add an `external-contributor` label in case issue was created by
someone external to the MetaMask organisation
4. Add a `regression-prod-x.y.z` label when possible, when `x.y.z` value
can be extracted from 'bug-report.yml' template

We will be able to leverage `regression-prod-x.y.z` and
`external-contributor` labels to improve our bug triage process and our
metrics collection.

## **Description**

When a malicious transaction is triggered from a dapplink, the blockaid
banner alert is not shown. This is because the transaction is shown in
the confirm screen after evaluation without calling PPOM.

The fix is to call PPOM before showing the transaction in the confirm
screen.


## **Related issues**

Fixes: #7543 

## **Manual testing steps**

1. Goto https://metamask.github.io/metamask-deeplinks/# and generate a
malicious Payment Request, set the recipient to this malicious address:
0x5FbDB2315678afecb367f032d93F642f64180aa3
2. Open MM Mobile and scan the QR code generated in 1 above
3. Enable Blockaid in Experimental Settings
4. You should not see a Blockaid alert
5. Checkout this branch, build and run on a physical device
6. Scan the QR code generated in 1 above
7. You should see a Blockaid alert.

## **Description**

<!--
Write a short description of the changes included in this pull request,
also include relevant motivation and context. Have in mind the following
questions:
1. What is the reason for the change?
2. What is the improvement/solution?
-->

It was discovered that the video begins crashing the app for iOS 17.2+
physical devices. While there is no solution in the latest
react-native-video package at the moment
(https://github.com/react-native-video/react-native-video/issues/3329),
we can patch it by removing the `controls` prop and temporarily use
custom controls (a play/pause + mute controls). The tradeoff is that
other features such as full screen and seeking will not be available on
iOS.

* Refactor `eth_sendTransaction` method handler

The method handler for `eth_sendTransaction` has been moved to a
separate module to simplify unit testing. Unit tests have been added
as well.

This module was written in TypeScript, which asked for some additional
validation of the method parameters. We now throw a more explicit
message when the params are missing, and when the transaction
parameters are not an object. Previously the method would still throw
an error in these scenarios, just with a less helpful message. The
change in error message should be the only functional change here.

This refactor is intended to make testing PR #5619 easier.

* Support `.cjs` file extensions

The Metro configuration has been updated to support `.cjs` file
extensions. The `@metamask/utils` dependency relies upon the library
`superstruct` which uses `.cjs` for its main exported module.

* Move utils dependency to 'dependencies'

* Inline functions from `@metamask/utils`

The two functions taken from `@metamask/utils` have been inlined as a
workaround to an error that gets thrown upon import on Android builds.

I'm still actively investigating that failure, so hopefully we can
replace these inlined functions soon.",380,56,1,0

The `handleNetworkSwitch` helper function no longer requires the
`frequentRpcList` state as a parameter. Instead it takes a reference to
the `PreferencesController`, and gets the RPC list state from that.

Typically it would be preferrable to reference controller state from
Redux rather than accesing it directly from the Engine global. However,
this function will be called from non-UI contexts, so it has to get
controller state from global context regardless.

On `main` two warnings were printed to the console repeatedly after
switching networks. They were:

* Error: Callback was already called. Possible Unhandled Promise Rejection
* MaxListenersExceededWarning: Possible EventEmitter memory leak detected ...

This started happening after PR #6872. If you look at network traffic,
you could see that this lines up with extra network calls being made to
the previous network as well (the `eth_getBlockByNumber` method
specifically).

These warnings were caused by a change made in
`@metamask/network-controller@6.0.0`, which was to proxy the provider
and block tracker. This introduced an incompatibility between the
`NetworkController` and `web3-provider-engine`, which was still using
the unproxied block tracker. `web3-provider-engine` adds an event
listener on the `latest` event from the block tracker, which calls
`eth_getBlockByNumber` with a retry. This listener was migrated to the
new network after switching, but would make that RPC call on the old
provider.

The user effects of this are an increase in unnecessary network
traffic, but is otherwise harmless.

The `web3-provider-engine` package has been patched to make the block
tracker event listener into a no-op after the provider has been
stopped. This isn't an ideal solution as it still leaves the listener
attached, which is a small memory leak. But it resolves the warnings
and prevents the unnecessary network calls. We will be updating to
`@metamask/network-controller` v9 soon which will resolve this problem
permanently by removing `web3-provider-engine`.

* Remove Fabric and Crashlytics

The Logger now logs to `console.log` exclusively.

* Add Sentry reporting

Errors are reported using `captureException`, and non-errors are added
as breadcrumbs. This means the non-error events won't be directly sent
to Sentry, but they will be included as context for any errors that do
occur.

The sentry configuration is mainly in the `sentry.debug.properties`
file. The only config outside of that file is the DSN used for
reporting errors, which is hard-coded in the `setupSentry.js` module.

There are three separate sets of config: default, debug, and release.
The default config is missing the auth token, so it can't be used to
publish source maps. However, builds that use the default config will
still correctly report errors to the `test-metamask-mobile` Sentry
project.

The debug config is identical to the default config except that it
includes the auth token. The debug config is for publishing any
non-production builds (e.g. testing, pre-releases).

The release configuration is to be used for production builds only.
This is the only config that sends errors to the `metamask-mobile`
Sentry project.

The debug and release config files have not been added to the repo.
They are automatically instantiated from the example files if the
`MM_SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` environment variable is set. Setting this
environment variable in CI should allow publishing from CI.

Closes #1321

* Use absolute path for Sentry file

The SENTRY_PROPERTIES environment variable is used at different
directory levels in the Android and iOS builds respectively; it's
used one level down with iOS, but two levels down for Android. This
means the properties path used is incorrect on iOS at the moment.

Instead an absolute path is now used, to prevent any such errors in the
future.

The error message for the missing auth token has been improved as well.

* Improve handling of missing auth token

The properties file is now checked to ensure the auth token is present,
so the build can fail early rather than partway through.

The logic for handling the auth token has been moved to a separate
function as well, so it can be shared between the release and
prerelease builds.

* Force setting METAMASK_ENVIRONMENT explicitly for release builds

The Sentry environment is set to `local` by default (e.g. for dev
builds), but the build script now requires it to be explicitly set for
release builds. This is to ensure it isn't missed in the production
builds, which are done manually.

* Ensure only Errors are thrown/rejected

Whenever using the `throw` keyword or calling `reject` in a Promise,
the value passed should be an Error. Various tools expect thrown
""errors"" to be errors; this is the convention. Using Error types is
also more useful for debugging, as they have stack traces.

* Update `Logger.error` function signature

`Logger.error` now expects an actual error object as the first
argument. This allows us to submit proper Errors with stack traces to
Sentry. The second parameter is an optional set of extra data, which
gets attached to the Error and is viewable on Sentry in the ""Additional
Data"" section of the error report.

Unfortunately any messages added to contextualize errors had to be
submitted as extra data instead of as a wrapper Error. Wrapper error
types provide for a richer debugging experience in general, because
you get additional context for the error plus an additional stack trace
to help trace the flow of the error. Sentry even has an Integration
meant to facilitate this pattern, the `LinkedErrors` integration.
But unfortunately that integration doesn't seem to work with React
Native, so that option was off the table.

* Update `@sentry` packages to latest

The most recent Sentry packages have better support for capturing
native crashes on Android. I had held off on this update at first
because I thought it required React Native >= 0.60, but apparently
not. It still works on 0.59, just not as well (no sourcemaps)",162,20,0,0

## **Description**
Currently users don't see any warning when connecting to a site on the
eth-phishing-detect list using wallet connect. This PR checks if the url
is flagged in the phishing controller and shows a warning banner when
connecting to such site.

## **Manual testing steps**

1. Setup [WC](https://github.com/WalletConnect/create-wc-dapp) locally
using `npx create-wc-dapp@latest web3modal-quickstart -id <PRPOJECT_ID>
-y`
2. Run your local server
3. In line 36 of `src/pages/_app.tsx`, change the default url in to a
flagged url from the phishing controller
4. Connect to the server on your device and connect to wallet.
5. If url in the phishing list, it should show the warning banner on the
connect modal else no warning banner.

ref: https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/issues/1984

Since infura 5.x.x empty string is invalid project id. Exception is thrown at launch `[Error: Invalid value for 'projectId': ""undefined""] `. This leads to confusion for Non-Metamask users who try to get the project compiled. Changing default value to `MM_INFURA_PROJECT_ID=""null""` will stop the exception. Restores behaviour to prior infura update.

 Non-Metamask users will still not be able to connect to any network. I make a note of this is README.md

## **Description**
The last step of the create-release-pr.yml workflow creates a release
branch, which shall itself trigger another workflow:
create-bug-report.yml. However, there is a security feature in Github
that prevents workflows from triggering other workflows by default. The
workaround is to use a personal access token (BUG_REPORT_TOKEN) instead
of the default GITHUB_TOKEN for the checkout action.

## **Description**
This PR fixes an Android SDK bug whereby:
- The wallet was always returning the first permitted account instead of
the selected account when connecting the SDK to MetaMask
- Changing the selected account on MetaMask did not fire a
`metamask_accountsChanged` event so the SDK did not get selected account
updated.

This change implements the `getApprovedHosts` to fix this issue. 

## **Manual testing steps**

_1. Have more than one address in your metamask account and select any
address as active address
_2. Connect from Android Metamask SDK and ensure the active account is
the selected address on the SDK
_3. Switch to another account on the wallet, and ensure that the SDK
updates to the new address

The `@metamask/controller-utils` package has been updated to v3.4. This

## **Description**


The smoke tests started failing once
https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/pull/7373 was merged. This
PR removed testIDs that were used in the permission system tests. The
purpose of this PR is to readd the testIDs so tests can pass.


Next step here is to ensure that we have a centralized location where
all testIDs live. If a testID gets updated in this shared location it
should not break the tests.

because the wrong type parameter was passed in).

The `fiatOrders` unit tests used selectors quite a lot, so there was a
need for a mock/initial root state shape. This was introduced in the
`app/util/test` directory for use in unit tests. This initial state
object represents just the minimal initial state that has been typed so
far. After we migrate all reducers to TypeScript and fix their types,
this state object will become increasingly complete/correct.

This is a follow-up to #7110, which laid the groundwork for these type
fixes but also introduced some of them accidentally.",109,62,1,0

**Issue**: https://github.com/MetaMask/mobile-planning/issues/999

**Description**

The purpose of this PR is to migrate our store from old redux to [Redux
Tool Kit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) - by focusing solely on
updating the engine

**Changes**:
- installed @reduxjs/toolkit
- updated store to use configureStore
- created file persistConfig to export the persistedConfig object to the
store file which will be more focused on configuring the store itself
only
- created a new space for future redux files in redux folder: for
selectors and slices
- migrated engine reducer into a state slice
- added unit tests for engine slice

**E2E Test**: 

https://app.bitrise.io/app/be69d4368ee7e86d/pipelines/b2781b20-539c-4f9e-b987-f9678ebc4ca5

**Possible future improvements:**
- finish migrating reducers to RTK - ones that are mutating the state
correctly can use createSlice or createReducer !
- replace thunk with createAsyncThunk or [React
Query](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/rtk-query/overview)
- move store file in reduxLayer 
- Upgrade Redux-Saga

**NOTION Page for the findings**:
https://www.notion.so/Redux-Toolkit-Performance-Upgrade-b10cb97d7ed44dfaa15b522951971037

**Current Reducers that need refactoring in the future for reference
(out of scope):**

- collectiblesReducer
- privacyReducer
- bookmarksReducer
- browserReducer
- modalsReducer
- settingsReducer
- alertReducer
- transactionReducer
- userReducer
- wizardReducer
- onboardingReducer
- notificationReducer
- swapsReducer
- fiatOrders
- infuraAvailabilityReducer
- navigationReducer
- networkOnboardReducer
- securityReducer

## **Description**

This PR uses `asdf` to install node and yarn versions during build
setup. Yarn setup was failing due to mismatch of node versions. The root
cause was traced down to Bitrise updating the configuration of the linux
image used to in the android builds. The specific node version did not
have yarn installed by default which cause the` yarn setup` step to
fail.

## **Related issues**

Fixes: NA

## **Manual testing steps**

1. Run this PR using the smoke test E2E workflow and it should pass.

## **Description**
This PR is removing configuration from project pbxproj file. On a quick
research, this will not have impact on our codebase.

-wl: This flag is often used to pass options to the linker. However,
without any options following -wl, it doesn't have any effect. Usually,
it's used in a format like -wl,option.

""-ld_classic"": This flag tells the linker to use the classic linker. The
classic linker was the default for OS X 10.5 and earlier. Starting with
OS X 10.6 (Snow Leopard), the linker changed to the ld64 linker. If
you're working on a modern project, you probably don't need to use the
-ld_classic flag.

## **Description**
- Migrate Logger.js to typescript 
- Optimize for faster output in dev
Previously the logger would start by synchronously accessing user
preferences even in dev which is unnecessary since logs won't be sent to
server.
It would also mess up the order of logs being printed depending on the
time it takes to access the DefaultPreferences.

## **Description**
Problem

To address the issue of the helpers.js file containing numerous test
actions, and assertions, which can be confusing for newcomers to the
framework, one possible solution is to refactor the code by extracting
the assertions into a separate assertion class. This will make it easier
to identify and use the assertions within e2e the tests.

Solution

Create a new file called assertions.js or any appropriate name for the
assertion class. The goal here is to remove the assertions in these
lines of code:
https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/blob/main/e2e/helpers.js#L121#L164
to its own assertion class.

In the assertions.js file, define a class that contains reusable
assertion methods.

Important: The introduced code will remain unused. This pull request is
3 of 3 PRs, which involves cleaning up the helpers.js file.

* Handle PhishingController breaking changes

The PhishingController was changed in v31 and v32 to no longer update
the phishing configuration regularly in the background. Instead it has
to be updated manually.

We now check for phishing configuration updates each time we're using
it to test whether a URL is suspicious or not. This matches how the
extension works. It should be roughly equivalent to how the Phishing
Controller worked in past versions, except that now it will no longer
be polling for updates when the browser is not in-use.

The phishing configuration is also explicitly updated once upon
construction.

## **Description**
To address the issue of the helpers.js file containing element matchers,
which can be confusing for newcomers to the framework, one possible
solution is to refactor the code by extracting the matchers into a
separate matchers class. This will make identifying and using the
matchers within e2e the tests easier.


### Solution
Create a new file called matchers.js. The goal here is not to chain
matchers with test actions. We want our test actions to take the element
matcher as an argument and then return the matcher (locator) for that
element.


**Important**
The introduced code will remain unused. This pull request is 1 of 3 PRs,
which involves cleaning up the helpers.js file.

* Update controller packages to core v44

Controller packages have been updated to roughly match the versions
used in v44 of the core monorepo (this doesn't include the keyring
controller, and a few packages are ahead of v44 already).

This update includes a significant breaking change: the migration of
`frequentRpcList` in the `PreferencesController` to
`networkConfigurations` in the `NetworkController`. Various other
packages have also been updated at the same time because they have a
peer dependency upon the `NetworkController`.

Closes https://github.com/MetaMask/mobile-planning/issues/798

* Improve prop type

* Improve local variable names

* Simplify variable assignment

Co-authored-by: Elliot Winkler <elliot.winkler@gmail.com>

* Add patch to remove chain ID hex validation

The method `upsertNetworkController` has validation to ensure the chain
ID is a hex string. This was introduced here prematurely, before the
core packages were updated to use hex instead of decimal. This
validation has been removed with a patch, which we can then remove when
updating to the core v53 packages (which updates chain ID to be hex in
every package).

* Improve type used for network configurations prop

* Fix automatic network switching

The network should switch automatically when adding a custom network
manually. This was broken because of an invalid option (`active` was
used instead of `setActive`).

* Add comment to patch explaining how it was generated and what it is for

A new `lint:tsc` command has been added to validate TypeScript types in
the project. This lint command uses a separate configuration,
`tsconfig.lint.ts`, which covers just the files that have no type
errors. We can expand the type check coverage over time as we fix more
type errors.

One additional change was made to fix a TypeScript error that hade an
impact on many files. The problem was caused by a TypeScript bug that
causes the compiler to fail when it encounters certain unicode
characters. Those characters were in a JSON file in the
`unicode-confusables` package. They have been temporarily removed until
this TypeScript error can be fixed.

## **Description**
* Adds a warning icon to contact addresses that are associated with more
than 1 chainId (ambiguous)
* Tapping icon opens bottom sheet with info that the address is
associated to more than one chain
* When selecting an ambiguous address in the Send To flow, an analytics
event is fired

## **Manual testing steps**

1. Install v7.6 of the app - checkout `release/7.6.0` branch
2. Add Ethereum classic via chainlist.org
3. Add a contact on Mainnet
4. Switch to Ethereum classic
5. Notice that the same added contact shows on ethereum classic chain
6. Checkout this branch. 
7. The app at this point should be able to identify ambiguous addresses
and display a warning icon in the contacts list for:
  a. Settings > Contacts
  b. Send To --> Contacts
8. In the send to flow:
a. If an ambiguous address is selected, you should see a warning message
on the Send To screen

       /**
	 * fix bug: https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/issues/2100
	 * 
	 * reason: redux-persist load storage data by 'getItem' API with a timeout (5 seconds default) when app ’cold start',
	 * on some old devices, I/O is slow and 'readfile' operation may take long time Occasionally, when this happened, timeout
	 * will lead to redux-persist rehydrate state with undefined and an Error(https://github.com/rt2zz/redux-persist/blob/master/src/persistReducer.js#89).
	 * 
	 * solution: the easy way to fix is to set a big timeout on config, Go further, we could save 'keyring' etc some important
	 * data to separate files or backup for this. the second way is not complicated, we could set
	 * serialize and deserialize to false to get JSON object and modify setItem/getItem API to save/load data.
	 */

* remove comment

* refactor: Update ENS utils to accept chain ID

The ENS utility functions now accept chain ID instead of network ID.
Chain ID is easier for us to access because we know the chain ID for
all configured networks at all times, as it's a required property. The
network ID has to be looked up dynamically at runtime, meaning that we
don't know what it is until after the network has loaded.

The network ID is still used internally by the ENS utility functions
because the library we use for ENS support still expects network ID
rather than chain ID.

This was done to simplify the upcoming network controller update. The
new update replaces `network` with `networkId` and `networkStatus`,
where the ID is `null` while the network is loading. This forces us to
handle that loading state anywhere the network ID had been used.
Reducing the usages of network ID means avoiding that work.

This relates to https://github.com/MetaMask/mobile-planning/issues/1226

* Fix network type enum references

* Add `getCachedENSName` utility function

The new `getCachedENSName` function will retrieve a cached name from
the cache, ensuring that we don't need to reference the cache directly
from elsewhere in the codebase. This removes another reference to the
network ID.

The testing setup was a bit awkward because `ENSCache.cache` is a
property, which Jest offers no way to mock out at the moment. But this
is resolved in jest v29 with the `replaceProperty` method. A workaround
using hooks has been used as an interim solution.",79,62,1,0

## **Description**

This PR aims to remove unnecessary dependency patch in
`SignatureController` (`message-manager` patch) and make
`SignatureController@4.0.1` patch a bit cleaner by putting a comment
(which branch patch created from) and remove unnecessary changes.

### **Why `message-manager` patch is removed?**
Since `controller-utils` is updated in to `3.4.0` in mobile repo, the
patch made in the `message-manager` is became unnecessary because
patched imports already been exported in `3.4.0`.

### What changed in the `signature-controller` patch?
Same exported enums were needed in the `signature-controller`, so these
patches are removed.
Also put a comment of how can we reproduce `signature-controller` patch
if needed.
https://github.com/MetaMask/core/tree/patch/mobile-signature-controller


## **Manual testing steps**

No functional change here.
But it's still beneficial to run regression tests around signatures.

## **Screenshots/Recordings**

before and after of your change._

All errors in Engine.ts have been resolved. This file is frequently
imported throughout the application, so fixing type errors here is
essential for making progress with eliminating type errors. Resolving
these errors required migrating the AppConstants module to TypeScript
as well.

A few errors were caused by dependency issues that will be resolved
soon after additional dependency updates, but I made note of some cases
that require further investigation and fixes.

As part of this effort, a `BackgroundState` type has been added as
well. This will be useful in later refactors related to controller
upgrades.

## **Description**
This PR introduces a new workflow (check-bitrise-e2e-smoke), which
applies the `Run Smoke E2E` label to the PR, kicks off a Bitrise build
(pr_smoke_e2e_pipeline), and will post a comment to the PR containing a
link to the E2E build. The workflow is triggered under 4 conditions:
1. Whenever the `Run Smoke E2E` label is added to a pull request
2. When a PR is opened that is not draft
3. When a PR goes from draft to ready for review
4. When a PR is reopened

## **Manual testing steps**

**Scenario: Triggered by adding the `Run Smoke E2E` label**
1. If the `Run Smoke E2E` label exists on the PR, first remove it.
Otherwise, skip to step two
2. Re-add the `Run Smoke E2E` label back to the PR
3. After a second or two, the `Check Bitrise E2E Smoke Tests` workflow
will run in the CI checks
4. Shortly after, the `Run Smoke E2E` label should be automatically
added to the PR
5. Once that workflow is complete, the github bot will post a comment
that contains a link to the Bitrise E2E build

**Scenario: Triggered by opening a non-draft PR**
1. Open a non-draft PR
3. After a second or two, the `Check Bitrise E2E Smoke Tests` workflow
will run in the CI checks
4. Shortly after, the `Run Smoke E2E` label should be automatically
added to the PR
5. Once that workflow is complete, the github bot will post a comment
that contains a link to the Bitrise E2E build

**Scenario: Triggered by making a draft PR ready for review**
1. Mark the draft PR as ready for review
3. After a second or two, the `Check Bitrise E2E Smoke Tests` workflow
will run in the CI checks
4. Shortly after, the `Run Smoke E2E` label should be automatically
added to the PR
5. Once that workflow is complete, the github bot will post a comment
that contains a link to the Bitrise E2E build

**Scenario: Triggered by reopening a non-draft PR**
1. Reopen a non-draft PR
3. After a second or two, the `Check Bitrise E2E Smoke Tests` workflow
will run in the CI checks
4. Shortly after, the `Run Smoke E2E` label should be automatically
added to the PR
5. Once that workflow is complete, the github bot will post a comment
that contains a link to the Bitrise E2E build

* Replace controller context

The `context` object previously constructed by the
`ComposableController` is no more. Instead each controller now accepts
its dependencies directly as constructor parameters, in a similar
manner to the extension controllers.

This was done in preparation for migrating to BaseControllerV2 and the
new controller messaging system - this is just a temporary solution
that will let us migrate controllers one at a time.

The style of dependency injection here matches the extension (at least
with newer controllers anyway). Specific methods and state snapshots
are injected rather than entire controllers, to help simplify unit
tests and make it easier to understand how controllers interact.

The `Engine.context` property was used throughout mobile, so it has
been preserved. It is now constructed explicitly, rather than being a
re-export of the `ComposableController` context.

This PR depends upon https://github.com/MetaMask/controllers/pull/387

* Pass in function for `getOpenSeaApiKey` rather than string

The API key was passed in directly by accident, instead of a function get returned the key. This has been fixed.

* Update `AccountTrackerController` options

The `AccountTrackerController` option `initialIdentities` was replaced
with `getIdentities`. The initial identities passed in here were
incorrect anyway due to a typo (`initialState.preferencesController`
was used instead of `initialState.PreferencesController`).

* Fix `getIdentities` handler for `AccountTrackerController`

* Set initial controller state

The `controllers` setter on `ComposedController` used to be responsible
for setting initial state. Since that setter has been removed, the
initial state is now set after the controllers have been constructed.

This should be functionally equivalent to what it was before. We're
setting the initial state by calling `update` on each controller, just
as the `controller` setter used to.

* Fix initial state variable reference

<!--
Thanks for your contribution!

Please ensure that any applicable requirements below are satisfied
before submitting this pull request. This will help ensure a quick and
efficient review cycle.
-->

**Development & PR Process**
1. Follow MetaMask [Mobile Coding
Standards](https://github.com/MetaMask/metamask-mobile/blob/main/.github/coding_guidelines/CODING_GUIDELINES.md)
2. Add `release-xx` label to identify the PR slated for a upcoming
release (will be used in release discussion)
3. Add `needs-dev-review` label when work is completed
4. Add the appropiate QA label when dev review is completed
    - `needs-qa`: PR requires manual QA.
- `No QA/E2E only`: PR does not require any manual QA effort. Prior to
merging, ensure that you have successful end-to-end test runs in
Bitrise.
- `Spot check on release build`: PR does not require feature QA but
needs non-automated verification. In the description section, provide
test scenarios. Add screenshots, and or recordings of what was tested.
5. Add `QA Passed` label when QA has signed off (Only required if the PR
was labeled with `needs-qa`)
6. Add your team's label, i.e. label starting with `team-` (or
`external-contributor` label if your not a MetaMask employee)

**Description**

The controller packages have been updated to match those present in the
core monorepo release v49. See this changelog for details:
https://github.com/MetaMask/core/releases/tag/v49.0.0

The main breaking change is that the `NetworkController` state property
`network` has been split into `networkId` and `networkStatus`.

**Screenshots/Recordings**

https://recordit.co/GXEdxk9uNp

Wasn't sure exactly what to manually test, but I confirmed that balance
updates and incoming transactions seem to be working well, as well as
network switching.

**Issue**

The handler for `eth_sendTransaction` was previously spread between

`web3-provider-engine`. Instead it is all handled in
`RPCMethodMiddleware.ts` now.

This should have no functional impact. It is difficult to trace through
`web3-provider-engine`, but this case is one of the easier ones because
the static middleware is run first, and in this case it will always end
the request.

* Add support for using Ganache in Detox iOS e2e tests

We can now use Ganache in iOS Detox e2e tests. This lets us write tests
that use network currency without relying upon test ETH in the account
used for testing, and it reduces reliance upon the network.

The `send-eth-flow` test suite has been updated to use ganache, to
demonstrate that this integration works. That test suite has been known
to be flaky anyway, which this should help resolve. The step where the
fiat currency switch was used has been commented out for now because it
does not work on localhost due to the lack of a conversion rate. It
will be restored in a later PR.

## **Description**
Catches `@metamask/providers` up several majors through
`@metamask/mobile-provider`. Needed as an intermediary step before we
ultimately get EIP6963 changes merged.

## **Manual testing steps**

* Open wallet (iOS)
* Go to In-app browser
* Visit https://metamask.github.io/test-dapp/
* Disconnect wallet if connected already
* Connect wallet via button on page
* Should prompt as it usually does
* Open safari
* Menu bar -> Develop -> Simulator -> Test Dapp 
* In console enter `window.ethereum.chainId`
* You should get a deprecation warning
*  In console enter `window.ethereum.chainId` again
* You should not get a second deprecation warning

## **Screenshots/Recordings**

You can verify `@metamask/providers` has been bumped if you see the
deprecation errors when accessing `window.ethereum.chainId`,
`window.ethereum.networkId`, and `window.ethereum.selectedAddress`

nickname is returned.

The documentation has been corrected, and the network switch result

misleading. No functional changes.

The `providerConfig` property of the `NetworkController` used to be
named `provider`, which was very easily confused with the `provider`
instance (and with various other things that we call ""provider""). When
that renaming happened, not all local variables and function names were
updated accordingly.

All references to `providerConfig` now use the term ""providerConfig"".

## **Description**

Currently the inpage injected scripts used in the in-app browser (for
making the wallet provider object available to the dapp) are currently
built in a separate `@metamask/mobile-provider` package. This PR brings
the build process into the mobile repo itself. This is needed in order
to support passing build time variables to the provider initialization
(for EIP6963 support).

## **Manual testing steps**

1. Pull in branch
2. `yarn setup`
3. `yarn watch`
4. `yarn start:ios`
5. Go to in-app browser
6. Visit test dapp
7. Verify that buttons are still functional
8. Optionally: Open safari debug console on the test dapp webview
9. check that `window.ethereum` is defined and `window.ethereum.chainId`
logs a deprecation warning

## **Screenshots/Recordings**
Note the deprecation warnings which indicates that provider v13.0.0 is
now being used

## **Description**

When a malicious transaction is triggered from wallet connect, the
blockaid banner alert is not shown. This is because the transaction is
shown in the confirm screen after evaluation without calling PPOM.

The fix is to call PPOM before showing the transaction in the confirm
screen.

## **Related issues**

Fixes: #7707 

## **Manual testing steps**

1. Open MetaMask Mobile
2. Goto testdapp and connect via wallet connect
3. Scroll to PPOM section and click the malicious send eth
4. You will see a confirm screen on mobile without the blockaid alert
5. Checkout this branch, build and deploy on device
6. Repeat steps 2,3
7. You will see same confirm screen as 4, but now with the blockaid
banner alert.

The variable name `network` is used to refer to a network ID, network
configuration, network type, network name, and various other things
(sometimes even in the same file!). This can make it very difficult to
understand what is happening, and it's a major obstacle to refactors of
the network state.

Most `network` variables have been renamed to make it more clear what
they refer to. Any instances of `network` that were part of data
structures shared externally (e.g. metrics, provider state) were left
alone, as were any cases that seemed too complicated to rename.
