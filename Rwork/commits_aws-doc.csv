* Dockerfile compatibility for newer Swift versions

Versions of the Swift docker image for version 5.7 and later have differences
that prevented the Dockerfile's instructions from working correctly, and did
not work with the `swiftbuild` script.  This is fixed in this commit thusly:

* Changed the Dockerfile to pull the most recent Swift instead of Swift 5.6.
  This is done because the Swift 5.6 docker image doesn't work for ARM Macs.
* Changed the name of `swiftbuild` to `swiftbuild.py` to clarify that it's a
  Python script.
* Changed the Dockerfile to invoke `swiftbuild` by directly executing
  `python3.10 swiftbuild.py`. This both uses the name for the Python installed
  on the more recent image and is updated for the new name of the script.

* Reword dockerfile comment

* Tweak wording one more time.

check issues with the 'type/epic' or 'status/icebox' labels.

This first iteration is debug-only. If the dry-run looks good we'll
turn off debug mode.

* Updates to build with Docker

Changes:

* Added a new `swiftbuild` tool in the `tools` directory. This Python
  tool is used by the Dockerfile to automate building the examples.
  The tool builds projects whose directories are given on the command
  line. Also supports running and testing the samples, suppressing
  warnings, and has a couple of options for altering the output of the
  command.
* Added the `.build` directory and the `Dockerfile` file to the new
  `.dockerignore` file, to reduce the size of the built image by not
  including build artifacts or the file used to build the image in
  the first place.
* Updated the `Dockerfile` to use Swift 5.6 since several examples
  require it, install Python for the build script to run, and the
  OpenSSL library and developer files needed to build using the AWS
  SDK for Swift. Finally, the `Dockerfile` now uses `swiftbuild` to
  build the examples instead of running Swift directly.

* Remove Dockerfile from .dockerignore

Also, fixes a couple of comments and adds a note to `README.md` pointing out

The current version of Amazon Linux is AL2023, thus it should be used as
the examples rather than AL2, which will be End of Life mid-2025.

For AL2023, we can skip weak dependencies, and by cleaning the dnf cache
we reduce the container image size (as we do not need to store the
downloaded yum repository metadata in the image).

In this case, the installed set of packages is smaller, and the
resulting zip file for the function is around 40% smaller!

AL2023 based: 22MB extracted, 6.6MB compressed

* Updated the 'archive' button with a more semantic look, and disabled it for archived items

Handle errors better when parsing the command line in the `swiftbuild` tool.
In addition, added code that checks each project directory for a file named
`test.sh`. If it exists, it is run instead of `swiftc test`, and its output
code signals sucess (0) or failure (any other value). This allows custom test
procedures.

Added a `test.sh` script to the `ListBuckets-Simple` example. This always
returns 0, signaling success, since there's no test for this example. Without
this, `swiftc test` fails, resulting in the test pass signaling a failure when
there isn't one.

As a bonus tweak, fixed a stray out-of-date syntax issue in the S3 basics
example's `Package.swift` file.",59,83,1,0

* More work on IAM scenario example for Swift

* More fixes

* More progress on getting tests for IAM basics

* Remove temporary hack

* Split service handler into per-service classes

* Swift IAM Basics example and tests

The IAM Basics example with tests for its service handler functions. Also
updates for the Swift IAM `README.md` file and the metadata for the functions
used in this example that don't already have SOS examples listed. This helps
to fill in a few gaps.

(There's also a comment correction in another example's tests, which slipped
into this PR and I'm hoping can just go through as is.)

* Fix duplicate SoS tag

Removes accidental stray `snippet-start` tag.

* Remove stuff added by accident

* Apply editorial changes from Liz

* Add Swift SDK and first example for it
Adds the first example for the AWS SDK for Swift.

* Renamed Cognito Identity example
I've renamed the example formerly known as CognitoIdentityDemo to

comments on PR #2800.

* Add metadata for SoS for Swift Cognito Identity
Working on the metadata for Swift Cognito Identity example.

* Removed Xcode file that shouldn't be therre

* Fix syntax problem in metadata for Swift / COGID

* Change comment type used for snippet start tags

* Fix incorrect file extension

* Restore descriptions of examples for Swift

* Test to improve Swift SDK Reference links

* Swift metadata tweaks

* Disable link_template for swift to try that

* More Swift metadata tweaks

* Fix typo

* Add missing punctuation to Swift metadata

* Missed saving a file

* Make all reference links go to main page Swift

* Update tests and improve compat for Swift SDK

* Finish Swift DeleteObjects example and tests

* Remove test output

* Remove unneeded end-tag for metadata

* Simplify deleteObjects() handler
Use a map instead of a loop to build the list of objects to delete.

* Further simplify

* Simplifying Swift code is fun!

* Add DeleteObjects to readme for Swift S3 examples

* Integrate suggestions from Liz

* Removed temporary test from DeleteObjects example
I had previously added a test to DeleteObjects' test suite
to check the behavior of XCTest in a certain case. I forgot
to remove it before my last commit. Now it's gone.
