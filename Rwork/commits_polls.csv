I understand the need to require a value for 'delete_date' column, but it should be done on the application level to support SQLite.

FYI, Nextcloud Server doesn't have any DATETIME column with a NOT NULL constraint, see:
https://github.com/nextcloud/server/blob/v17.0.1/core/Migrations/Version13000Date20170718121200.php#L752
