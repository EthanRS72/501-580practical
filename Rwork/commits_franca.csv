introduces a separate method only for the EclipseErrorReporter precisely
to clean IDE markers.

This matters in case of AST transformations. The test framework uses an
AST transformation to set tests as CCpp, and it needs the context set in
order to do the AST transformation. But the context would need to be
computed after the AST transformation in order for it to get the right
target. This is the least invasive way to sidestep this dependency
cycle. I acknowledge that there may be performance consequences, but I'm
not concerned about performance consequences until they are shown to be
of practical significance. The fact is that if we do not cache, we do
not have two inconsistent views of the targetConfig in the presence of
AST transformations that touch the targetConfig.",41,50,1

This does not change the output of `lfc` even when an error appears in
an imported reactor. The code just was not doing what it was claiming to
be doing AFAICT other than redundant work, since it was being invoked
after a round of validation checks had already passed. And it is even
worse than that, because it was running the validator without the right
ValidationIssueAcceptor injected, resulting in behavior that was not
consistent with that implemented in StandaloneIssueAcceptor. I decided
to delete the whole thing rather than a) make this code work properly
and b) spend some unknown number of hours fighting with Guice. The fact
is that it is doubtful whether the behavior that it was supposed to have
is even what we want. I am not sure that users really need their import
statements to be highlighted with errors reported on the imported
reactors.",43,52,1

Issue #1284 was caused by the mimization step of the shadowJar gradle plugin.
The main problem is, that we don't import kotlin classes directly, but load
them manually in order to work around the build problems in Eclipse... Hence,
the minimizer thinks it can exclude the Kotlin classes. While in
principle it is possible to add particular excludes, this does not work properly
when we compile a second time. The reason for this is unclear, but we might as
well disable the minimization. This slightly increases the jar size from 23 MB to
28 MB.

The problem here is that we use the uniqueID of the federate both before
and after we transform it into separate programs. After we transform it,
the name of the instance depends on the name of the main reactor, which
might be different (indeed, it must be different in order for us to
eliminate the possibility of name collisions with other parts of the
program). So this is a bit of a hack, but I'm not sure what else to do.",46,54,1

This fixes a nasty bug in FileUtil, where an input stream was read twice when

array and hence write an empty file.

Sometimes, a downstream federate can exit without waiting for the upstream federate to finish. This could cause a send_message or send_timed_message to fail catastrophically (sometimes during message delivery). The graceful TCP shutdown demands that all incoming messages be received until the sender closes the socket. In case of a loop, there should not be a deadlock because federates close their outbound connections unconditionally during termination before waiting for incoming connections to close. If the program hangs at this line, it could most likely be due to an error somewhere else in the program logic.",30,27,0

Defining template types in header can cause redefinitions in case of contained reactors
using `#if defined/#undef/#define` construct can cause type collission as contained reactor
can use the same template literals for different types than the parent reactor

To solve this issue we decided to go for string substitution in header file to rersolve
templated types to their respective concrete types and we'll still be using `#define` in scource files
as the template types need to be defined as per instantiation in the source file

* Create a simple hook for nightly builds (#305)

The current workflow builds the Eclipse RCA and packages it, packaging the
created files into:
- org.lflang.rca/target/products/lingua_franca_rca_*-win32.win32.x86_64.zip
- org.lflang.rca/target/products/lingua_franca_rca_*-linux.gtk.x86_64.tar.gz
- org.lflang.rca/target/products/lingua_franca_rca_*-macosx.cocoa.x86_64.tar.gz

Now we just need a place to push them to.

* Add release action to upload artifacts

* Alter name of secret for better distinguishing

* fix: add commit reference to the release

* fix: ensure rewriting the archives works as intended

* Update .github/workflows/nightly-build.yml

* Add lfc build and asset deletion

* Address comment by @cmnrd and make script version agnostic

here. Besides, I have found that in at least one test program a segfault
is fixed by using the commit referenced here (d28a9f5).",25,56,1

The time and conceptual effort required for this particular commit
reflect poorly on the implementation. This was partly because complex
logic was implemented in the toString function, which makes debugging
exceedingly difficult when setting breakpoints (since the debugger
itself invokes toString). However, the complexity also comes from the
statefulness of the renderable components (a possible design mistake),
as well as from the (possibly inherent) difficulty of keeping track of
comments as them bubble up to ever higher syntactic levels in search
of a home.",60,44,1

That this aesthetic improvement should have to be done in this way is
concerning. Ideally, it would be performed by changing the badness
function, but the badness function itself already could in principle
do the job in some cases -- but in the implementation, it doesn't,
for an algorithm that with certainty minimizes global badness would
be have exponential time complexity.

That said, this is a sensible and probably reasonably future-proof
heuristic. Programming constructs tend to have bodies at the end
(or lists of expressions, or whatever) and metadata at the beginning
(types, mutability, etc.), so usually, the expression at the end is
the largest, and the consequences of representing it differently are
the greatest (in particular, in terms of reducing line length
violations).",59,44,1

Currently, all command line options that need to be passed on from lfc to the

the automagic passing in a for loop from before with explicit code for each
individual option. While it is a bit more verbose, this has some advantages:
- The code is readable and understandable
- IntelliJ produces a useful warning when an option is not used and therefore
not passed on

This change further removes some unused code and includes other small cleanups.

This patches a tiny edge case that might not show up in practice. The problem is that the Rust code is being generated into an existing project (i.e., there is already a Cargo.toml file in the src-gen directory), which means that sometimes srcGenPkgPath != the actual package root (according to cargo). The cost of collecting and parsing the metadata is probably not negligible, so it would be nice if we didn't have to do this.

There are a few reasons for this change
* the key is everywhere being computed from an Instantiation, so this
 change reduces the total amount of code
* hash codes can occasionally collide, and I was not sure that this
 particular hashcode was very effective at minimizing collision
 probability.
* but more importantly, the hash codes were being computed from
 information that does not uniquely identify the Instantiation. It was
 being computed from the name of the variable that holds the instance
 and from the name of the reactor class being instantiated. So if the
 same reactor class were instantiated and stored in a variable of the
 same name in multiple places, this could result in bugs.

This change means that we are using physical equality to check the keys
to the hashmap because we don't have our own IR and we can't override
the hashcode and equals functions of Instantiation. But I think that's
OK. After AST transformations, which should happen as upstream as
possible, we are working with one single object representation of the
program.",46,54,1

and because the caught exception was not the
exception we expect. Now we throw a more specific
exception type and only catch that one. This way
if the test fails the error message will be reasonable.

Throwing `new Exception` from xtend code is anyway extremely bad
practice, because the exception cannot be caught from a Java caller.

complains if a resource cannot be found at all, but not if the resource is an
empty directory. Aside from a bit of cleanup, this fix ensures that a useful
error message is also produced if a submodule is missing.",43,51,1

The issue was not exactly a concurrency bug in the sense that data was
not being set to an invalid state (AFAICT) by concurrent access. But it
was in the sense that shared state was causing an error in the
compilation of one federate to abort the compilation of another
federate. This is OK -- it might even be desirable -- but it is a source
of complexity.

The root cause of the problem is that non-errors were being reported as
errors. That is the only aspect of the issue that is being fixed here,
and maybe the only aspect that really needs to be fixed.",39,50,1

individual option. While it is a bit more verbose, this has some advantages:
- The code is readable and understandable
- IntelliJ produces a useful warning when an option is not used and therefore
not passed on

This change further removes some unused code and includes other small cleanups.

When we use `target: CCpp` on a program that was written for the C

will still compile since C++ is not quite a superset of C. What if the

for which are given in C? Then they should use `extern ""C"" {}` if they
want their code to be interpreted as C++. Concretely, this would mean
scaling back our integration tests so that we do not require everything
