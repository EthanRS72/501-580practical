**Background**

The current state of the ""sap_horizon"" theme has been compliant to the Fiori Next Alpha Figma Design,
that suggests a lot of changes in metrics and new interactions (new states). We have been able to implement all the core components (except for the Button).

But, as the whole design is not yet validated and subject to change, we have decided not to do any changes in metrics or adding new states for now and keep the standard FIori_3 metrics and just consume the new theme variables and apply changes, that are validated and explicitly defined by the Design Team.

However, to keep the current implementation, we are going to introduce a new experimental theme, called **""sap_horizon_exp""** (private and hidden) that will serve as base for testing the Fiori Next vision within the technology.  And, **""sap_horizon""** will be restored to its initial state - using the standard Fiori 3 metrics.

**With this change:**
- `!` _**""sap_horizon""**_ uses the standard Fiori_3 metrics and developers are meant to start work on and apply the Designers' Feedback
- `!` **_""sap_horizon_exp""_** is an experiment and private theme, implementing the Fiori Next Alpha Figma Design.

Note: to test the change, checkout the PR, rebuild, start and use the following pages (or use the respective query param): 
- Displays the core components in _**""sap_horizon""**_
http://localhost:8080/test-resources/pages/CoreControls.html
- Displays the core components in **_""sap_horizon_exp""_**

However, our users might need some of these variables we don't use and provide and **we agreed on switching to `@sap-theming/theming-base-content` as a source for all theme parameters** and thus having all the parameters available for the users of the`@ui5/webcomponents`

The PR is part of a bigger story to Add support for Timezones in the localization package
- updates to latest `""@openui5/sap.ui.core"": ""1.112.0""` and `""@types/openui5"": ""^1.112.0""`
- includes a new module `sap/ui/core/date/UI5Date.js` from ""@openui5/sap.ui.core"" in the `localization` package.
- uses the `sap/ui/core/date/UI5Date.js` module in localization package instead of `new Date()`
- adds a private `timezone` config setting that is now used when configured, otherwise the local browser timezone is used as before
- updates the `OpenUI5Support` module to reuse the `timezone` from the OpenUI5 configuration , if present.

The change is related to the Quick View topic and affects the Input, InputSuggestions and Popover, and enables the following behaviour: (1) open an additional Popover from a suggestion on mouseover and suggestion-item-preview events, (2) to move the focus in that Popover, (3) to keep it open without a visible opener, and (4) the ability to get back via ESC.
Add parameter to the openBy method to prevent the popover from closing when its opener is not visible anymore
and use the old placement when the opener is gone (by default the popover would go to the top-left most corner).
Add public method Popup.prototype.applyFocus (the logic has been extracted from applyInitialFocus) that focuses the first focusable element inside the Popup
Change the focus retaining logic in Input/InputSuggestions as follows: returns the focus to the input field only when a suggestion is selected by the user, in other cases - does not, because otherwise focusing another popover would not be possible as the Input keeps getting focus again and again.

The change adds a new set of icons, based on the newly introduced **SAP-Icons5.0 font** as part of the existing **""icons"" package**. The goal is to display the new icons only in Fiori Next sap_horizon theme and keep using the old icons for the rest of the themes.
Components and applications will keep using the current icon imports and the framework will detect the theme and render the corresponding icon from SAP-icons4.0 for Fiori 3, and SAP-icons5.0 for Fiori Next. No changes are required neither by the component developers, nor by the app developers - **backward compatible icon imports.**

BREAKING CHANGE: The icons SVG imports are changed. If you previously had
```js

The change addresses few issues when generating a web component project with our tools:
### Command `@ui5/webcomponents-package` updated
- added new parameter `componentName` and derive the tag name from it
- added new (private) parameter `skipSubFolder` to generate all files in the execution context, not in a new folder (defined by the packageName parameter) as by default
### Command `create-web-component` updated
- remove the ""typescript"" parameter and just check for the existence of `tsconfig.json` to generate TS or JS component.
- update ""componentName"" validation to allow only letters, starting with capital one - Foo, FooBar, FooBarBar
- remove ""tag"" parameter, the tag is now produced based on the component name - ""foo-tag"", ""foo-bar"", ""foo-bar-bar""
### The `test` command
- fixes failing `yarn test` command due to a bug in `test-runner.js`
### Themes updated
- no longer showcase ""belize"", ""horizon"" is now used in the test page instead
### Eslint improved
- added eslint config file pointing to the default config in `@ui5/webcomponents-tools`

Replaces the HTML comments inside the HBS templates with HBS comments as suggested in the related issue and following the [official docs](https://handlebarsjs.com/examples/comments.html). The HBS comments are stripped from the output and are available only to developers at DEV time, while the HTML ones are part of the output and could be observed in the browser. After this change only the lit-html comments can be seen.

Previously (the comment is part of the lit template)

```js
const block0 = (context, tags, suffix) => html`<div class=""ui5-panel-root""><!-- header: either header or h1 with header text --><div @click=""${context._headerClick}""
```
After (the comment is removed)

```js
const block0 = (context, tags, suffix) => html`<div class=""ui5-panel-root""><div @click=""${context._headerClick}""
```

As the related issue suggests, I went trough the list of tasks:

- [ ] investigate the hbs2lit script's handling of comments  - we can look at this more closely, so far haven't found anything specific to comments, the following [line] somehow seems relevant at least it has ""comment"" in the name (https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/blob/master/packages/tools/lib/hbs2lit/src/partialsVisitor.js#L95)
```js
CommentStatement: function(/* comment */) {},
```


- [X] add support for hbs comments, if necessary - have not found issues so far, HBS comments work as expected
- [x] use hbs comments everywhere (fix all current  templates) - done with the change

The customElement decorator used to set default values for languageAware = false, themeAware = false, fastNavigation = false when the fields are not provided. However, this leads to a wrong metadata in case the field is set by a parent class. Then, the value set by the parent class won't be considered as the child class already set it to ""false"" and as expected the values set by the child class are taken with precedence.
For Example:
- Calendar component does not set languageAware at all (but gets languageAware: false by default)
- Calendar's parent class DateComponentsBase has languageAware: true
- When merging the metadata of the inheritance chain to get the resulting metadata, the Calendar's metadata is taken with precedence and languageAware is false at the end, but should be true.

Currently, for older themes (sap_belize, sap_fiori_3) we display old icon fonts, while for sap_horizon - the latest icon fonts. This applies for all icon collections. And, to do that we check if the current theme is part of the sap_horizon theme family or not. However, once an app is using custom theme, the current theme has a custom theme and by default we will enforce the old icon fonts, because the custom theme name won't match ""sap_horizon"".
With this change, when the current theme name is not part of the built-in theme families, we now look for an custom theme and check the base theme that the custom theme is built upon:
rename isThemeFamily to isLegacyThemeFamily and adopt it in the code (all isThemeFamily(""sap_horizon"") calls are replaced with !isLegacyThemeFamily)
isLegacyThemeFamily now checks the baseTheme of the custom theme if present
add test (one when built-in theme is set and when theme designer custom theme is used)

Background
There are complains that if the user is at the very beginning of a step and scrolls a bit upwards, the selection switches to the previous step, although most of the viewport is taken by the first one.

This has been raised with #2883:
""5. scroll up a little bit of the cascading goal dialog, and you can see the fact that although the most of dialog is step two, but the wizard will highlight the step one button. this is an issue, because the current step is still step two""

Solution
Add private/protected API, called step-switch-threshold
to give more control of the point the switch happens.
It support float values between 0.5 and 1, where 0.5 means the step will be switched after the user scrolls half of the current step, and 1 - when the current step is entirely scrolled out. The default value is 0.7, which is very close to the behaviour of the sap.m.Wizard.

Usage

<ui5-wizard step-switch-threshold=""0.5"">
<ui5-wizard step-switch-threshold=""0.6"">

However, there is one use-case when the Input web components uses `ui5-input` inside the InputPopoverTemplate.
The solution in this PR is to consider component's own tag and add it to the list of tags subject to scoping, unless the tag is not explicitly excluded via configuration. This seems to be an edge case, so if alternative solution comes to mind, feel free to share it with me.

**Background**
Previously we used to create `ui5-shared-resources` semantic HTML element to store shared resources (as registered runtimes, tags and SVGs) that can be reused between multiple UI5 Web Components runtimes.
The element used to be appended to the `head` in the past, but this produced invalid markup when tested with HTML validators as there is specific list of allowed tags that can be inserted in the `head`. To address this, we moved the `ui5-shared-resources` to the `body`.
However, currently we got another issue with `the body not being ready` at the point we access it and try to append the `ui5-shared-resources`. And, this issues is subject of the current PR.
**Solution**

Recently, we have changed the behaviour of the Icon to fire ""click"" event only when ""interactive"" attribute is set.
However, there are valid use-cases when an icon should be clickable and to fire ""click"" without having a focus outline, tab stop. Such use-case is the Input with a slotted icon to implement a SearchField type of functionality. In this case setting ""interactive"" would lead to double focus (one on the input and one on the icon) when the user clicks on the icon, and additional tab stop.
With this PR:
- We changed the configuration to always have ""click"", even in no conflict mode (previously only ui5-click used to be fired)
- We now fire ""click"" for both interactive and non-interactive icons, in detail:
on mouse-up
- noConflict true: native ""click"" event
- noConflict false: native ""click"" event
on SPACE and ENTER (relevant only for interactive icons)

### Background
SFSF has requested a missing icon (""bookmark-2"") that they would need in 3 weeks for their 2205 release.
The icon has been implemented and part of the latest icon font editions since end of January.
The change adds the requested icon + several more new icons that are missing and adopts all updates in the latest 4.13 (v4) and 5.01 (v5) icon fonts.

###  Update existing v4  and v5 icons to latest
- adopt icon font version 4.13 for SAP Quartz (shows too many changes because spaces have been turned to tabs)
- adopt icon font version 5.01 for SAP Horizon

### New icons 
- e293; icon-heart
- e294; icon-heart-2
- e296; icon-bookmark-2

Previously calling `attachBoot` used to trigger `boot`, which was causing unexpected issues.
One effect of this was that theme properties were not loading properly. This happens when the theme registration (triggered by component define call) comes after someone calls `attachBoot`. In this case, our logic looks for a registered theme properties, can't find any and continues without loading. 
Later when the registration happens and boot is called again, we reuse the created promise and just return,
and we no longer reach to the point to check and continue with the theme properties loading:
The PR fixes exactly the described problem:
- `attachBoot` does not trigger `boot` anymore - only registers listeners, called after boot finishes.
- adds a test to cover the use-case

In some cases the OpenUI5Support feature is enabled but sap.ui.require(""sap/ui/core/Popup"") returns undefined leading to exceptions when trying to read Popup.getNextZIndex().
The root cause was the import order of the modules. The OpenUI5Support feature module was included after the component's import and the features was not enabled on framework boot and not initialised properly. As a result the Popup hasn't been loaded and later when getNextZIndex is called, requiring the Popup from OpenUI5 fails and returns undefined.
Although we can add a check and prevent the exception, actually it's better to leave it failing, but add a message why the exception is thrown and how to correctly one should use the OpenUI5Support feature.
In addition, the documentation has been improved to explain this part.
For framework features is important to be enabled on boot, e.g to be imported after the components (the components definition triggers boot) so that they serve their purpose.
For example, when OpenUI5Support feature is enabled the framework reuses fonts, configuration and other assets from OpenUI5, otherwise we use ours and it does not makes sense to enable the feature later when the framework already initialized/booted and we already used or config or loaded our assets.

Recently we [changed](https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/pull/6981) our tsconfig to use Module Resolution [""node 16"",](https://www.typescriptlang.org/tsconfig#moduleResolution) instead of ""node"" to get better ECMAScript Module Support:
- 'node' for Node.js’ CommonJS implementation
- 'node16' or 'nodenext' for Node.js’ ECMAScript Module Support [from TypeScript 4.7](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/typescript/announcing-typescript-4-7/#esm-nodejs)

However, we faced issues on the application side. The TS compiler throws errors in Typescript applications that uses UI5 Web Components for files in applications' node_modules. More specifically, the problem was caused by new attribute  ""'resolution-mode'"" added to the auto-generated .d.ts files that requires also tsconfig change by the project installed our code.

```sh
Error: node_modules/@ui5/webcomponents/dist/DateComponentBase.d.ts:1:23 - error TS1452: 
'resolution-mode' assertions are only supported when `moduleResolution` is `node16` or `nodenext`.
/// <reference types=""openui5"" resolution-mode=""require""/>
```
Although these errors can be handled with `skipLibCheck` flag set to ""true"", it's a bad experience to require a particular flag to just make an app working and we decided to revert this as it's seems the setting is not stable enough and can cause unexpected problems for consumers.

New ui5-toast component is introduced.

Sample changes:
More samples are added in the playground, which demonstrate default
Toast, as well as some short/long duration options for the component.
Also the script for the handlers in now simplified/shortened in both
playground and test pages.

Style changes:
Added ""--_ui5_toast_background"" and ""--_ui5_toast_shadow"" CSS parameters.
Font-family, color, and font-size of the ""ui5-toast-text"" are now on the
host.
These changes give the web-component user, the freedom to alter
the styling of the Toast.

CSS class name changes:
The ""ui5-toast-root-parent"" class is now renamed to ""ui5-toast-root"".
The ""ui5-toast-root"" class is now called ""ui5-toast-content"".

Animation changes:
The transition (fade out animation) is now handled differently.
It is still a third of the Toast's duration property, but if
it happens to be more than 1000ms, we force it to be 1000ms.
This way we omit prolonged fade out times, when
the duration property is longer, than 3000ms (default).

Tests changes:
Spec files are now aligned with the new transition behaviour.
Also some new tests are now added in order to cover mose cases.

Now if the user inputs duration lower than 500ms, we
force it to be 500ms.

Additionally the following changes are made:

* CSS variables are now aligned with the new convention.

* Toast's text styling is now part of the ui5-toast-content class.

* A span which is the container of the Toast's text
is now removed from the hbs.

* One of the Toasts in the html sample is now with invalid duration ""-1"".
This is in order to test if the minimum duration is applied correctly.

* Added test in the spec file, which tests the new minimum duration behaviour.

* The sample.html is reduced in volume.",29,10,0

On re-rendering the Wizard auto scrolls to the currently selected item's top, which is useful when the step selection is changed programatically. But, when re-rendering occurs for some other reason and the step selection remains the same, the Wizard still scrolls to the top of the selected step, which is not expected. Now, this is fixed by checking if the selection has been changed.

As we improve the keyboard handling more and more, it turns out the Item Navigation does not handle Page Up and Page Down combinations. The change has been triggered from this recently merged SegmentedButton PR and this in progress
Timeline PR where we manually handle the focus on PageUp/Down. Now, the code from the SegmentedButton is removed, as the ItemNavigation takes care of it.

For most of the components, Page Up/Down should behave as Home and End. But some of the components has specific predefined number of items that should be skipped before applying the focus to the next item. Therefore, we also introduce a new property ""skipItemsSize"". In this change only the List is using it.

In the initial implementation we removed ""display: none"" and start hiding the columns with width=""0px"" and position=""absolute"" and thus not having any issues with the column animation. Because in general the width animation can not run from 33% to display:none, when ""display:none"" and the ""width"" are set in same browser reflow.

But, not using ""display:none"" leads to other issues, mainly accessibility. The slotted content within hidden columns might be accessed by TAB even if we set tabindex=""-1"" in the shadowRoot it does not help, the user should do the same to the external content. Also, if the app needs to start with OneColumn and later open the other columns, having display:none set will reduce the browser work on initial rendering.

- the TimePicker on phone used to have a header with a close button that is not supposed to be displayed,
the component has a cancel button in the footer, this default header is meant for other components.

The Icon component is not imported, although used. Not marked as dependency.
If someone bundles just the RatingIndicator, the Icon component will be missing and actually the stars won't be displayed.
Also, when we don't mark it as dependency, we break the scoping, which adds suffixes to the dependencies of the component - the case with the issue, linked below. The users enabled the scoping feature and used ui5-rating-indicator-demo, but in the Shadow DOM, the ui5-icon did not get its suffix (ui5-icon-demo) and thus not rendered.

@ui5/webcomponents/dist/Icon.js

Note: the src property will continue to work until the next release due to the impact of the change, but will produce a warning in the console.

The avatar property was removed.
Use the avatar slot instead - pass an icon(<ui5-icon) or an image(<img).
Before:
<ui5-card avatar=""sap-icon://add""></ui5-card>
After:
<ui5-card><ui5-icon name=""add"" slot=""avatar""></ui5-icon></ui5-card>

**Issue**
When the opener element is taking full width and the placement is set to ""Right"" (same for ""Left""), the popover tried to open on the opposite side, but both sides are not possible and the popover remains cut off with only its arrow visible.
**Solution**
Now, it checks ""Bottom"" and ""Top"" sides as well. 
**Note1:** The fallback is applied before the allow-target-overlap to be taken into account, which means that Popover with placement ""Right"" or ""Left"", will try to open on all sides, before overlapping its target.
**Note2:** The fallback is used currently for ""Left"" and ""Right' only for two reasons: (1) it fixes the issue that was originally reported by the MDK colleagues and (2) all the components, that use popover internally (f.e DatePicker) have placement=""Bottom"" and the change would have bigger impact, that I would avoid before release. 
**Note3:**
The full solution is to have this fallback for all sides + placement type ""Auto"" that should be the default value and would try to open on ""Right"" first.

The PR aims to add support for registering versioned/theme dependent custom icon collections.
Previously, one could register an icon collection (f.e. ""my-icons"") with the use of `registerIconLoader` and use it with the Icon web component.
However, there is no API to register theme dependant version of the same icon, so that whenever the theme is changed the used SVGs are auto-switched behind the scenes.
Now. `registerIconLoader` can be used to register additional second version (won't fail in case of multiple versions, but at the end the separation is ""legacy"" vs ""sap_horizon"" theme families) and use the newly supported field ""themeFamily"" to define in which themeFamily the icon collection should be used. If ""themeFamily"" is not present, by default it means in all themes (sap_belize_*, sap_fiori_3_*) other than ""sap_horizon"" theme families.

Changes: 
- The whole `packages/base/src/` directory (but one file - `packages/base/src/renderer/directives/style-map.js`) is now in Typescript. See the configuration in `packages/base/tsconfig.json`.
 - All types, relevant to the framework, are now described in the respective modules, and reused. See `UI5Element.ts` and `UI5ElementMetadata.ts` for the most important types.
 - Some global variables (e.g. `sap`) are allowed on the `window` object - see `packages/base/global.d.ts`.
 - Some generated files (message bundles) are excluded from Typescript checks (`@ts-ignore` used).
 - General-purpose types (not related to the framework directly) are reused from `packages/base/src/types.ts`.
 - `eslint` is now configured for Typescript. See the typescript-specific configuration in `packages/tools/components-package/eslint.js`. 
 - Typescript `enum`s are now used instead of objects for enumeration types.

BREAKING CHANGES:
 - **Important for application developers.** The deprecated `altTag` metadata setting is now removed. All components that were used with the old tags will no longer work.
 Affected components:
 1. `ui5-datepicker` -> use `ui5-date-picker` instead
 2. `ui5-timepicker` -> use `ui5-time-picker` instead
 3. `ui5-busyindicator` -> use `ui5-busy-indicator` instead
 4. `ui5-segmentedbutton` -> use `ui5-segmented-button` instead
 5. `ui5-togglebutton` -> use `ui5-toggle-button` instead
 6. `ui5-radiobutton` -> use `ui5-radio-picker` instead
 7. `ui5-messagestrip` -> use `ui5-message-strip` instead
 - **Important for component developers.** The deprecated `RenderScheduler.js` class is now removed. Use the corresponding methods from `Render.ts` (former `Render.js`). 
 Affected methods:
 1. `RenderScheduler.renderDeferred` -> use `renderDeferred` from `Render.ts`
 2. `RenderScheduler.renderImmediately` -> use `renderImmediately` from `Render.ts`
 3. `RenderScheduler.whenFinished` -> use `whenFinished` from `Render.ts`
 - **Important for component developers.** The `animations/` functions have new signatures. They used to have one parameter of type `object` with animation settings inside. Now, the settings are separate parameters, and fewer settings are exposed overall.
 Affected functions:
 1. `slideUp`- has one parameter of type `HTMLElement`. Usage: `slideUp(element)` instead of `slideUp({element})`. 
 2. `slideDown`- has one parameter of type `HTMLElement`. Usage: `slideDown(element)` instead of `slideDown({element})`.
 3. `scroll` - has 3 parameters. Usage: `scroll(element, dx, dy)` instead of `scroll({element, dx, dy})`.
 - Some internal base utility functions have been deleted for different reasons: e.g. `setToArray` no longer needed due to the discontinued IE11 support. These changes should have no effect for applications or component developers, but will break code that imported them.
 Deleted files:
 1. `util/setToArray.js` 
 2. `util/isDescendantOf.js`
 3. `util/isSlot.js`
 - The `ResizeHandler.ts` and `DOMObserver.ts` classes have been simplified. Functions, allowing to inject custom implementation, have been deleted, as they were only needed by IE11 code. These are: `setCreateObserverCallback`, `setDestroyObserverCallback`, `setResizeHandlerObserveFn`, `setResizeHandlerUnobserveFn`. This change should have no impact on any production code.
 - Some utility modules were renamed. 
 Changed files:
 1. `isNodeClickable` => `isElementClickable`
 2. `isNodeHidden` => `isElementHidden`
 3. `isNodeTabbable` => `isElementTabbable`

### **Background**
**We no longer need to support IE.** We plan to remove IE specific code, including specific CSS styles. Another important aspect, which is the goal of this PR, is the ability to **make use of the CSS Logical props to implement RTL** (at least for majority of the use-cases) without need of direction detection and setting the ""dir='rtl'"" attribute into the ShadowDOM. 
Thus, using native browser capabilities and improving the rendering performance (especially in lists with many items) by reducing the calculation of the effective direction.
### **Plan**
**We will roll out our plans to refactor all current RTL styles, however this PR aims to verify the approach, to serve as an example and give rough idea how the CSS logical props can be incorporated. Moreover, we will need to start using them for new RTL implementation.**

Issue: If you remove/delete a number/character in Input type=""Number"" with Backspace and you click somewhere else, e.g. focus out, the deleted number/character gets back into the input field.
Root cause: The ""_handleInput"" handler works with event from type ""InputEvent"" that never has ""key"" or ""keyCode"", that's why ""isBackspace"" or any other checks regarding pressed keys will always result in false.
Solution: The solution is to execute the logic on keydown where the ""KeyboardEvent"" has ""key"" or ""keyCode"", store the result and later use it in ""_handleInput"".

Introduce ui5-wizard and ui5-wizard-step components that enables users to accomplish a single goal that consists of multiple dependable sub-tasks. The ui5-wizard-step API defines both the content of particular step and its corresponding tab, displayed within the Wizard's navigation header with the icon and text properties. Also, the component provides selected and disabled properties, that determine which step is currently ""selected"" (active), which ones are enabled or disabled. Тhe Wizard does not provide ""move to next button"", instead we give the user freedom to decide how to move to particular step. It might be button, or something else, placed inside the content of step. At the end, to move to particular step, the user can use the API of the ui5-wizard-step (selected and disabled).
In terms of user experience, the wizard allows navigation between enabled (validated) steps upon clicking the steps within the navigation header and via scrolling. When these interactions occur, the wizard updates the selected state and fires selection-change event to notify the interested parties.

The old icon is still shipped, so the change is compatible. In addition, all usages of ""add-polygone"" are replaced with ""add-polygon"".
Still, in our docs we refer to the Icon Explorer where one can see only the old name, and probably won't ever see the fixed name. However, as we don't have a better alternative of the icon explorer, we will leave this as it is and wait for central fix.

With this change, `ui5-badge` is defined as a component that may be nested in a `badge` slot.

To implement badge support (e.g. for `ui5-button`):

1. Define a `badge` slot:

`packages/main/src/Button.js`:
```js
slots: /** @lends sap.ui.webcomponents.main.Button.prototype */ {
	/**
	 * Defines the optional <code>ui5-badge</code> that will be used.
	 *
	 * @type {sap.ui.webcomponents.main.IBadge}
	 * @slot
	 * @public
	 * @since 1.5.0
	 */
	badge: {
		type: HTMLElement,
	},
}
```

2. Same as above, for the Handlebars template:
`packages/main/src/Button.hbs`:
```html
<button>
...
	<slot name=""badge""></slot>
...
</button>
```

3. Use the `::slotted([ui5-badge][slot=""badge""])` selector to apply styles:

```css
::slotted([ui5-badge][slot=""badge""]) {
	min-width: 1rem;
	background: var(--sapContent_BadgeBackground);
	border-color: var(--sapContent_BadgeBackground);
	color: var(--sapContent_BadgeTextColor);
	padding: .25rem;
	border-radius: 1rem;
	justify-content: center;
	font-size: var(--sapFontSmallSize);
	margin-inline-start: 0.25rem;
}

- [ Refactor ] Previously entire page of items is being moved in and out of the view during navigation. Now, the items are moved in and out the visible area one by one, in other words all the items are shifted to the left and to the right by one.
- [ New Implementation ] Initial accessibility spec is implemented (as in openui5), but can be further improved as it does not handle the multiple items per page case the best way.
- [ Bug Fix ] Previously the navigation arrows were remaining displayed, although no previous or next item is available and pressing the arrows didn't perform any action. Now, the arrows remain hidden if no previous/next item is available to navigate towards.
- [ Bug Fix ] Previously the navigation arrows have been misplaced in IE, making the component not usable at all 
as the next arrow is out of the viewport ([reproduce in IE](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/master/playground/main/pages/Carousel/)). Now the arrows are displayed correctly in IE too.
- [ Bug Fix ] Previously setting ""selectedIndex"" that is out of range brings the component to unacceptable/ broken state. Now, the ""selectedIndex"" is validated and changed to its default value when not valid.

This is related to the recently stopped support of IE, allowing us to implement RTL using features, not supported on IE, as the CSS logical properties.
The Browser flips the paddings, margins, etc. automatically based on the direction - there is no need to write specific RTL styles manually. At least for the styles that have CSS logical prop alternative.
In case, there is no CSS logical props alternative or the use-case is very specific as with the Popover's arrow margins, which are different in RTL and LTR (not even mirrored), we extract them as CSS vars and add them to global rtl-parameters.css as we do for the cozy/compact styles.
Doing so, from one hand side we turn more to native implementation and standards, from the other we want to avoid effectiveDir calls as internally getComputedStyle is called, which is slow.
Changes:
- Popover's arrow rtl styles are refactored with the rtl-parameters.css pattern
- This style does not have ltr counter part and did not apply when testing, so I removed it
```css
:host [dir=""rtl""] .ui5-responsive-popover-header {
	padding: 0 1rem 0 0;
}
```
- right is replaced with inset-inline-end
```css 
.ui5-popup-resize-handle {
	/* right: var(--_ui5_dialog_resize_handle_right); */
	inset-inline-end:var(--_ui5_dialog_resize_handle_right);
}
```
- The Dialog's resize icon does not need ""dir"" set",130,38,0

This PR adds possibility to replace all static getters, such as `static get dependencies`, `static get render`, `static get template`,`static get styles`, etc. with TS decorators to make component development even more declarative.
- **super** can't be  called in decorators -  expressions like `...super.styles` and `...super.dependencies` can't be used with decorators and we need to refer the base class explicitly (see TreeItemBase)
- `static get render` is deprecated in favour of `renderer`, which is more appropriate name. For compatibility, we internally still support the `static get render` as before.
- all ""main"" components already refactored

**Background**
After splitting the SAP TNT icons to support 2 version - v2 and v3, we now have a top level module , that refers to and imports the versioned ones.
Before the split, the top level module used to export the icon name, including the collection (""tnt/actor""). 
After the split, the top level module (built from different flow) includes only the icon name (""actor"").

```js
// In recent RC release the exported value is ""actor""
import actor from ""@ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt/dist/actor.js"";
```
 [RC release](https://unpkg.com/browse/@ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt@1.11.0-rc.2/dist/actor.js) 

```js
// In our latest release the exported value is ""tnt/actor""
import actor from ""@ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt/dist/actor.js"";
```
[latest release](https://unpkg.com/browse/@ui5/webcomponents-icons-tnt@1.10.0/dist/actor.d.ts) 

**Changes**
- fixes this incompatible change.
- adds test for the exported value per collection.
Note: for the default collection, as before, we keep exporting just the icon name (""accept"" from SAP Icons).",121,48,1

Background
The DateTimePicker component alows users to select both date (day, month and year) and time (hours, minutes and seconds).
The component opens a popover with calendar and time controls.
On smaller screen and on phone device there is a switch to change between the calendar and time controls.

- reuses the DatePicker template and WheelSlider component
- refactors the DatePicker to make it more extensible and overwrite few methods

### Change
 Adds new `getThemeRoot/setThemeRoot` public API.
 **Note:** script configuration `themeRoot` setting and standalone `themeRoot` URL param **are not public**. 
 The feature is relatively specific, thus providing the minimum full-filling the request.
### Background
The `themeRoot` setting is specific to custom themes, created with [UI Theme Designer](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/playground/customizing/theme/) and allows fetching a theme from external location, e.g theme root.
When `themeRoot` is set, the framework will use it as a base URL and fetch the theme CSS variables from the following constructed URL: `${themeRoot}Base/baseLib/${theme}/css_variables.css` (a specific path [UI Theme Designer](https://sap.github.io/ui5-webcomponents/playground/customizing/theme/) themes).
### Usage
It's possible to configure the theme root either 
- [new] with JS API:
```js
import { setThemeRoot } from ""@ui5/webcomponents-base/dist/config/ThemeRoot.js"";
setThemeRoot(""https://my-example-host.com/"");
```
- [as before] as part for the `theme` URL parameter:
```sh
index.html?sap-ui-theme=mytheme@https://my-example-host.com/
```

- useAccessibleNameForToggleButton added - if true, the accessible name is also applied to the button, when a header slot is present
- aria-label/aria-labelledby support is removed, since they have been added as a previous fix to the same issue and did not fix it actually, the cases in the issue are covered via the properties mentioned above
- now a ui5-button is rendered only when a header slot is provided, otherwise a ui5-icon is rendered - this covers some minor bugs mentioned in the issue.
- headerAriaLabelledby is removed - this was added because of https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/issues/2188 ,but makes no sense and it is not correct. When a header text is provided and visible, it should be available for all users. Overwriting this text will cause the following problems: the screen reader user will not know the title of a panel, the standard user will not know the overwritten text labelling the panel. If the developer want a custom labelling of the panel (not the header, the header should stay as provided in headerText) he should use the accessibleName property or a header slot.

 - Do not inject any CSS in `_updateFragment` for IE11 (if `shadyDOM` is `true`). 
 - Inject the static area CSS along with the normal CSS in `createComponentStyleTag` instead, where it will be processed like the regular CSS

Background
There are use-cases with multiple versions of the framework with some of them with OpenUI5Support enabled and others not. One of the consequences is that the z-indexes of popovers/dialogs on the page are not synchronised as the next z-index is calculated differently when OpenUI5Support is enabled and when isn't.
Solution
To always enable the OpenUI5Support feature.
However, we had to ensure it's completely safe and won't have a side effect when the feature is imported, but OpenUI5 is not loaded on the page. And, this is what the PR addresses by refactoring a single usage in applyTheme and using OpenUI5Support.isOpenUI5Detected to check if OpenUI5 is available in the runtime.

Resolves https://github.com/SAP/ui5-webcomponents/issues/2259

Tokenizer is a component which (for now) is not used standalone. Its main use case is to be used within MultiInput & MultiCombobox.
The wrapping controls (MultiInput & MultiCombobox) style their layout using a flexbox, Tokenizer does the same in order to align the tokens. So, we end up with nested flexboxes.

The Tokenizer however, has hidden texts within the flex elements and this leads to some strange behaviour where the whole wrapping control missalignes to its base line.
The CSS Styles which are responsible for hidden texts (Acc), are defined globally and are reused within the Tokenizer. They rely on some absolute positioning with big dimesnisons, so the element won't fit in the visible area of the window. This solution breaks the nested flexboxes and for that case in the Tokenizer, we need to workaround it and implement an own, custom solution.
This solution aligns the hidden texts along with the other flex elements without breaking the layout.

### **Background**
The SVG tag itself should be rendered with the html function, but its content must be rendered with the svg function of lit-html. Otherwise dynamic updates inside the svg do not work.

### **Othe changes**

**ui5-icon**
- Create Icon HBS template and remove the IconLitTemplate as it will be generated properly

**ui5-shellbar**

- Update ShellBar`s CoPilot animates (taken from latest openui5)
- Make ShellBar`s animated CoPilot add-on feature, by default the CoPilot is displayed as static SVG .
To make it animated you have the following public import:
```js
import ""@ui5/webcomponents/dist/features/CoPilotAnimation.js"":
```
- Start considering the global `animationMode` config regarding the CoPilot animation

Issue
When UI5WC ui5-date-picker is opened inside UI5 dialog, click ""ESC"" wrongly close whole dialog.

Root cause
It's an integration issue between UI5WC Popups and OpenUI5 Popups - the focus never gets to the DatePicker's popover as it's not recognized as an external content by the sap.m.Dialog.

Solution
While we are working on more general, out of the box solution by integrating UI5WC Popups and OpenUI5 Popups, we would like to provide the following solution for the time being:

Forwarding the ""data-sap-ui-integration-popup-content"" attribute from the component that opens popup to its the static are item, which makes the static are item an external content for the sap.m.Dialog (as the aforementioned attribute is already part of the OpenUI5 logic). When the attribute is present, the focus goes inside the DatePicker's popover and the ESC behaviour works as expected.

The issue was occuring only when you write wrong value in input, focus out, then select something and without focusing out write the same wrong value in the input and then focus out. This was not triggering the change event of the input, hence we were not validating the value, because the input would have same value before and after the selection.
Now we set the value to the input when we select, so the input would react to every value change.

**Background**
So far in npm we have stable versions, such as `1.0.0-rc.3, 1.0.0-rc.4, 1.0.0-rc.5`.
Now, we decided to release intermediate versions on demand as a preview with `@next` tag,
that would look like: `0.0.0-{hash}`

**How to install it**
To get the last published version under the 'next' tag,
 you need to append `@next` as below:
```js
npm install @ui5/webcomponents@next
```
Without the tag, as you usually install dependencies,
you get the latest released and stable version
```js
npm install @ui5/webcomponents

We have an issue which occurs when using the ui5-menu component, where the opener of the menu is aligned to the right side of the screen. When attempting to hover over the sub-menu items, they unexpectedly close or disappear. This problem occurs more frequently when the cursor is moved slowly.
The cause of this issue seems to be a small gap between the menu and the sub-menu items, which is only noticeable when the opener is aligned to the right side of the screen. This issue can be frustrating for users who are trying to navigate the menu and its sub-menus.
- With this change, the sub-menus are aligned properly ( including in RTL, LTR mode ).

The import to the Tent illustration was wrong. Previously the import used to include the ""sapIllus-Scene-Tent.js"" which is the illustration just for one of the sizes (the illustration changes on resize). However, we need to import the top-level module ""Tent.js"" as it's the one to register the illustration ""Tent"" in the illustration registry.
And to force the ""Scene"" size, we can set it directly in the template as the IllustratedMessage provides a property for it - ""size"".

In the test pages and the playground sample we have all illustrations as part of the bundle, so the problem can't be seen - it does not matter if it's written as before or even if we don't add the import at all, the illustration will be displayed.

We used to set tabindex=""0"" to the selected item and tabindex=""-1"" to the rest, which works fine in all cases, besides the one reported in the issue - when the application wants to define a group without preselected item. In this case, all the radio buttons in the group have tabindex=""-1"" and as a result the group is not accessible via the keyboard.
Now, we calculate the tabindex for each item on every important action, such as: selection of item within the group, creating a new group, adding an item to the group or removal an item from the group. The logic considers the use-case from the issue as well - If the group does not have a selected item, the first (not disabled) item would have tabindex=""0"".
In openui5, this is handled by the sap.m.RadioButtonGroup control, here it is implemented within the RadioButtonGroup util class.

The UI5 Web Components documentation specifies that the CheckBox, RadioButton, and Link components have a 
`wrappingType` property with possible values of `""None""` and `""Normal""`. For each component, 
if `wrappingType` is set to `""Normal""`, the documentation specifies that: ""The text will wrap. The words will not be broken based on hyphenation"". For the UI5 ""Classic"" Framework's controls, they also support `""Normal""` for `wrappingType`, where the documentations specifies: ""Normal text wrapping will be used. Words won't break based on hyphenation.""
We assume that the wrapping implementation of `""Normal""` for the UI5 Web Components should be the same
as the implementation of `""Normal""` for the UI5 ""Classic"" Framework's controls.

On Chrome, clicking on slotted elements (light DOM) in the
dialog (shadow DOM) causes the focus to travel up the light DOM tree to
reach the closes element that is focusable.
Which ends to be the body element as document.activeElement.

This is not the case for FF & Safari, where the focus travels up the
slot, reaching the dialog root which is actually the closest focusable element.

This change introduces a workaround to align the focus behaviour in Chrome
with the other browsers.

**Issue**: the valueStateMsg popover does not show up when the user clicks on the search icon.
**Root cause**: the ShellBar uses a timeout to focus the input to ensure it is displayed and ready to be focused, but sometimes the timeout executes too late. 
- First, the Iinput checks (onAfterRendering) if it should show a valueStateMessage and one of the requirements is to be on focus, which is still false (the timeout is called later) and does not show the popover.
- Then, the timeout is called, moves the focus to the input, but it does not trigger re-rendering and the popover does not show up.
**Solution:** update the state (Input ""focused"" property) immediately, keep the focus move delayed.

This is especially useful in SPAs with a path-based routing strategy, where you don't want to induce a page refresh when clicking on a breadcrumb item but still be able to open an items href in a new tab (e.g. by right-click on it, select open in new tab).",120,35,0

Fixes
TimePicker was never considering contentDensity and did not update the styles of its popover so far.
DatePicker and DateTimePicker used to call updateStaticAreaItemContentDensity before the staticAreaItem DOM is available.
Solution:
Handle setting the contentDensity on framework level when possible and remove updateStaticAreaItemContentDensity calls from ShellBar, ComboBox, Select, Input, MultiCombobox. The updateStaticAreaItemContentDensity method exists and used in the TabContainer only, because the component does not invalidate on overflow popover open/close and needs to force the contentDensity update.

The PR addresses several issues with context setting within the lit templates by the HBS-2-lit compiler.

Issues that are resolved with this change:
- when ""@root"" is used in HBS template - it will throw an error: invalid or unexpected token
when trying to access root context from nested loop with ""{{../../text}}"", it will compile to ""{{text}}"" (""context.text"" would have been correct) and will throw an error
- After the nested each (level 2) completes, the default context is set the root one ""context"", but it should be ""item"" as the execution continues in the top level loop.
- After the nested each (level 2) completes and trying to access the root context with ""{{../text}}"" from the top level loop fails as it compiles to ""item.text"", instead of ""context.text"".
- Note: one major issue still remains with the ""../"" syntax. Even after the change ""../"" syntax only works when trying to access the root context, as we have only one root context represented by the ""context"" variable. But when it comes to moving between different levels of loops - it still does not work.
After the change, parsing {../text}} generates properly ""item.text"", but ""item"" points to the wrong object - points to current object not the object of the outer array as shown below
- There is another BLI for refactoring, where this is described. We need to maintain a stack of contexts and use it when generating the templates to pass the correct one.

Hello @SAP/ui5-webcomponents-topic-p
this is related to the recently stopped support of IE, allowing us to implement RTL using features, not supported on IE, as the CSS logical properties.

The Browser flips the paddings, margins, etc. automatically based on the direction - there is no need to write specific RTL styles manually. At least for the styles that have CSS logical prop alternative.

In case, there is no CSS logical props alternative or the use-case is very specifi, we can extract CSS vars which will have different value in RTL and LTR and add them to global rtl-parameters.css. The same pattern (sizes-parameters.css) that we currently use for the cozy/compact styles.

Doing so, from one hand side we turn more to native implementation and standards, from the other we want to avoid effectiveDir calls as internally getComputedStyle is called, which is slow.",122,38,0

### Background
Recently we got requests for customising the Select (but also other dropdown components), especially when it comes to the  visual of the items in the drop-down, in this case the Select's options. The consumer would like to add additional icons, custom markup or different colouring.

### Change
The PR aims to allow full customisation of the Select web component  (the options and the presentation of the selected option within the Select's text field) by introducing SelectMenu (the popup) and SelectMenuOption (the option) components, and the SelectMenu can slot truly physical options that can by styled from outside as regular slots.

add pointer-events: none to host component so in case it is disabled,
the browser does not call click handlers registered to it.

add chai for better assertion messages

* move click handler to shadow dom
this way, the component can handle the click first and then the app handler
will have the correct component state in its click handler

* remove event-related qunit tests
With click handlers registered in the shadow dom, the qunit tests
can no longer simulate events correctly.
For these scenarios, the wdio tests will be used anyway.

On Safari the style that stretches the content flex: 1 1 auto is not working the same way as in the rest of the browsers. Two issues have been observed:
(1) One with the Wizard, the navigation header used to not remain at the top, but scrolled together with the content, which breaks the scrolling/navigation of the Wizard
(2) One of the Dialog itself - the header and the footer are not displayed correctly (see below), because of the content not stretched correctly. Adding ""height: 100%"", when the ""stretched"" property is set did fix the issues.

Problem description:
The ui5-button tooltip text was supplied trough the
private ""title"" property. As result the same title
attribute was placed to the ui5-button element and
to the inner native button element, which was causing
duplicate tooltip announcements.

Solution:
New public ""tooltip"" property is added, which results
in placing ""tooltip"" attribute to the ui5-button element
and a ""title"" attribute to the inner native button element.

Issue: Interactive elements should not be nested inside element with role option.
There are nested interactive elements inside list items in selection mode - ui5-radio-button & ui5-checkbox.

Summary of changes:

the role mapping is changed from listbox -> option[] to list -> listitem[];
the selected state announcement is handled separately with aria-describedby as the listitem role does not support aria-selected;
aria-multiselectable is removed because it is not supported on the role list;
Note: aria-labelledby should not be used for the ""Selected"" & ""Not Selected"" texts as NVDA reads the whole value of the attribute when some of its references changes content. In this case - the whole content of the item.",185,31,0

Background. To enable easier generation of Angular wrappers/directives out of UI5 Web Components in terms of Angular Form support, we need to append more information to our existing API JSDoc (and to the generated api.json), such as what properties are Form related, what events are related to the change of Form related properties.

- New prop level annotation @formProperty - describes the form associated properties for form submission
- New prop level annotation @formEvents - describes the event(s), fired when a form property changes",132,44,1

The PR introduces the following changes:

**project  build**
 - rework the project build to always prepare `base` and then `main`, `fiori` (currently done in parallel) so that Typescript finds all dependencies when running on components from `main`, `fiori`.
**base** package
- several ""base"" types refactored to pure Enum whenever possible - see `ValueState`, `CalendarType`, etc.
- type `PopupState` removed as not used
- `UI5ElementMetadata` handles the pure Enum case (see UI5ElementMetadata#validateSingleProperty)
**main** package

- Fixes the issue: when the user clears the input of the TimePicker, value-state=""Error' is set, but should not as empty value is allowed and valid (this is how it works in openui5). And, the user also gets ""change"" event and he/she always can set  ""Error"" state when encounter an empty value.
- Refactors the TimePicker tests entirely, as they used to depend on some hardcoded ids that change whenever we add new TimePicker components in the test page.

**Background**
By default the focus (managed by ItemNavigation) does not cycle trough the items, which turned out that has not been working.
**Root Cause**
We check for the `cycle` config when border cases are reached (first or last item), but the only thing we do is to fire a private event (""_borderReach""), but updating the index, so it actually makes a whole loop (cycle).
**Fix**
In these border cases we just update the internal index to `0` (when ""top"" border is reached) and `items.length-1` (when ""bottom"" border is reached).",24,9,0

**Background**
Our native title used to be ""h1"", which is indeed wrong. In openui5 it is ""h2"" and it is not configurable. But, in the related issue the author wants to be able to change the title level in general. Although we provide the possibility of a custom header, the author is asking for this feature to make use of the fact that the the entire native header is clickable and focusable, which is not the case with the custom one.
**Options**
So, we either reject this and (1) hardcode it to ""h2"" as in openui5, (2) introduce a property as in this change, or (3) make another slot for the title, but then we will have the current ""header"" slot and ""headerTitle"" slot and it might be confusing.
**In this change:**
- [refactoring] Use div with role=""heading"" and ""aria-level"" attrs, instead of ""h"" tag to  enable the configuration of the level. Reuse the existing TitleLevel enum (""H1"" to ""H6"") and extract the number part, but AriaLevel type (""1"" - ""6"") is also an option.
- [FIX] sync the parameters in the latest visual design and change few variables
- [FIX] title now truncates, previously it used to wrap.
