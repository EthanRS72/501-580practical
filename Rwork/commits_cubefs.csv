The kernel is sending Forget requests without waiting for the responses,
so it is not limited by the value of FUSE_DEFAULT_MAX_BACKGROUND. And
there is a chance that kernel sends tons of Forget requests in a very
short time which runs out of memory.

Update atime in inode get operation, so that temporary file validation
can be extended.

A temporary file is defined as file which is created and removed
immediately by a process, and only the one who is holding the file
descriptor can manipulate the file. However, metanode has difficulties
telling whether a zero-nlink inode is orphan or some user is still holding
the fd. In order to eliminate dirty orphan inode, there is a mechanism to
evict expired zero-nlink inode.

This patch avoids the wrong eviction of read-only temporary files.

This commit makes AppendExtentKeyWithCheck request idempotent to avoid
conflict extents error when client retries.

For example,
    -> client writes [0, 100) to extent 25,
    -> send AppendExtentKeyWithCheck to metanode (offset: 0, size: 100, extentID:
25, discard extent: nil),
    -> client overwrites [0, 100) to extent 30,
    -> send AppendExtentKeyWithCheck to metanode (offset: 0, size:
100, extentID: 30, discard extent: 25),

Think about the following scenario: metanode managed to deal with the request,
but failed to respond to the client, and client retries with the same request.
Since AppendExtentKeyWithCheck is not idempotent, this will lead to
conflict extents error.

    -> client send AppendExtentKeyWithCheck to metanode (offset: 0,
size: 100, extentID: 30, discard extent: 25),
    -> when metanode is dealing with such request again, it expects no
discard extent, so it will respond a conflict extent error.

The best way to address that is to backport patches or upgrade
rocksdb. However this is a big move for cubefs. So let's just
switch these errors off temporarily to make gcc happy.

.write on exist extent normally happened and create a new extent to write. but for snapshot scenarios extent be split
and the last extent to append write directly may occur conflict because the position may have the splited extent and effective,
thus we need make a additional jugement for GetEndForAppendW, if split happend then not reuse the extent.
update: add space log for datanode

.Snapshot mod append on tiny extent should use replay extent that may be new

.origin design use the end of old tiny extent id while modAppend, but that process not use get and put ways,
and it's not safe if parrelle. still can be hanged if parrellel already use the tiny extent id

.update tiny modAppend process from modAppend to tinyAppendWrite
.tiny write directly need with follower addrs or else repair later but read may not get it
.inode ek be truncated considered as split 2) code optimizition on createLowerVersion

.extent key be splited and be dropped through extDelCh and freelist, multi ext key belong to one extent
the eks before the last one should just the make a hole on the extent,but the last one should delete the whole extent.

Two clients writing to an overlapping file range concurrently may cause
the file unreadable. The scenario is like this:

    clientA                                 clientB
        |                                       |
    write [0,100) to extent 25                  |
        |                                       |
    send AppendExtentKey to metanode            |
    (offset: 0, size: 100, extentID:25)         |
        |                                       |
        |                                    write [0,200) to extent 30
        |                                       |
        |                                   send AppendExtentKey to metanode
        |                                   (offset: 0, size: 200, extentID: 30)
        |                                   which will delete extentID 25 asynchronously.
        |
    write [100,200) to extent 25
        |
    send AppendExtentKey to metanode
    (offset: 0, size: 200, extentID: 25)

The file range [0,200) is pointing to extentID 25 which is deleted due
to the AppendExtentKey request from clientB. So reading this file will
cause an ""extent not exist error"".

This commit introduces a new AppendExtentKeyWithCheck request which
will prevent from two clients writing to overlapping file range
concurrently.

In the following scenario,

-> client issues a create dentry request to metanode;
-> meta node receives the request and applies the raft log;
-> meta node gets killed before sending a response to client;
-> client get a EOF error and retries to the new raft leader;
-> the new meta raft leader send a dentry exist error to client;

This error happens if create dentry request is applied but metanode is
not managed to response to client.

So if the create dentry request has the same parent inode id, name and
inode id, then we can treat it as successful.

Adopting a one-phase commit means that the master processor (MP) considers the prepared version as valid, and during the operation, it treats it as a version. This means that the MP may have partial temporary version information. However, the final valid version is on the master, which means that the dependency for reading historical versions on the edge side is the version list of the master, not the version list of the MP. When attempting versions in the form of 0, 100, 150, 200, with 150 being a temporary version, the version 100 is read, and it needs to include 150; otherwise, some data cannot be read due to the temporary version 150. Therefore, on the client side, it is necessary to read using the formal version's seq-1 method, which means reading version 199.

Question: The MP is distributed with versions, some of which have temporary versions and some do not. How should the cleanup of temporary versions be handled? If the dentry is in a partition with temporary versions, but the inode is not, when reading the dentry and obtaining the temporary version, is it possible for the inode data to be misaligned?

1) For example, file creation in version 0, creating temporary version 50, with the dentry in the MP being effective, but the inode partition not being effective. At this point, if the dentry is deleted, the retained temporary version 50's dentry information remains, but is it possible that the inode has already been deleted, resulting in an exception when reading with temporary version 50?

2) For rename operations, referring to the situation described in 1), as long as it is not read, it will not affect the final state, and version cleanup should also not affect the previous state.

Analysis and answer: 1) User operations will not delete the inode because the dentry must be deleted first. 2) When cleaning up temporary versions in snapshots, the inode will not be deleted because inode version cleanup only considers intermediate versions. 3) When reading, the edge side reads the next formal version minus one, so it sees a consistent version. Therefore, there is no need for targeted processing in this case.

This patch introduces an Interface HandleReadDirer, which implements
ReadDir to read partial sub-dirents accroding to request offset and
size.

From now on, readdir could be implemented in two ways:
 * ReaddirAll reads all sub-dirents one time
 * Readdir reads partial sub-dirents and the caller needs to call
   it multple times if more sub-dirents are requested
 * If both are implemented, Readdir is used

The Linux *close* syscall invokes the fuse Flush method which is not
implemented before. So the data might still in client's buffer after a
file is closed. Although there is no data persistence requirement for
the *close* syscall, we'd better wait for data to be synced so that
other clients can see the latest data after the file is closed in this
client.

traverse() marks streamer's ExtentHandler as closed periodically to
write cached data back. However, if the current handler is closed,
new write request has to create a new one and that prevents writing
data to the previous extent continously if possible.

Instead of marking ExtentHandler closed, this patch flush handler
directly.

This patch addes two http handler ""/suspend"" and ""/resume"".

**suspend**
Suspend has one paremeter, which is a Unix Domain Socket used to send
fd. Suspend stops reading more request from /dev/fuse. It waits all
handling requests to finish, then saves serveNodes and serveHandles to
locale files (""/tmp/ChubaoFS-fuse-Nodes.list"" and ""/tmp/ChubaoFS-fuse-
Handles.list"" by default). After that, cfs-client exits.

**resume**
Resume could stop Suspend before cfs-client exists.

Http's Expect header is a special header. When nginx is used as the
reverse proxy in the front end of ObjectNode, nginx will process the
Expect header information in advance, send the http status code 100 to
the client, and will not forward this header information to ObjectNode.
At this time, if the client request uses the Expect header when signing,
it will cause the ObjectNode to verify the signature.
A workaround is used here to solve this problem. Add the following
configuration in Nginx:

proxy_set_header X-Forwarded-Expect $ http_Expect

In this way, nginx will not only automatically handle the Expect
handshake, but also send the original value of Expect to the ObjectNode
through X-Forwared-Expect. ObjectNode only needs to use the value of
X-Forwared-Expect.

preReserveSpace is used to avoid writeOp failed when disk is rdonly:
eg: client try to write data on a rw dp, when request arrive datanode server and
find disk is already rdonly, which will cause writeOp failed and have to retry other dp,
once many disks are going to be rdonly(cluster used factor is too bigger), which will casue
a lot retry in clients, make writeOp become slow.

diskRdonlySpace is bigger than reservedSpace,
if reservedSpace < freeSpace < diskRdonlySpace, writeOp is ok, but disk or dp will be rdonly,
if freeSpace < reservedSpace, writeOp will also failed.

The blacklist mechanism has been added to the user store and volume
manager in the object node to solve the adverse effect of a large number
of invalid requests on system performance in a short period of time.

Stream requests to the user store and volume manager in the object node
in a hash bucket manner, reducing the blocking caused by read and write
locks under concurrency.

Abstracted the user store and added an implementation that does not
cache user information. This is enabled through the ""strict""
configuration to provide sufficient real-time performance with cluster
information during interface compatibility testing.

current senario
1) seq update: updated as the volume information is fetched, and later it is updated based on changes in the verlist of data and meta. However, it does not have real-time capability.
2) The dirty flag of ExtentHandler is written back to the datanode, which means it is prepared for flushing to the metanode.
3) For appending ek, find the previous appendable ek. If ExtentHandler is not closed, the ek will include the previous ek (Note that it is difficult to control here as the previous ek might have already been asynchronously written to the meta or it may be in transit. After data is returned and before meta is returned, dirty is true).
To append as a whole, where meta and data have changed but the client may not perceive it in a timely manner, the range of the appended ek is larger, including the previous ek (an extent). When meta is processed, it is used directly.

Improvements:
Approach 1: Without modifying the client, append the ek to the meta. The meta will differentiate the range based on the existing ke conditions, for example, if the new ek range overlaps with the old one, it will proactively split into two sets and assign a new version number to the newly added ek.
Approach 2: If the meta detects that the client's requested seq is outdated and its own seq has advanced beyond the client's request, it will return to the client. The client can then modify its ek to be appended based on the current version information returned by the meta and the current state of eks in the meta.

conclusion:
Option 1 is relatively simple and covers more scenes.

If the replica becomes a leader, the service will return an error.

Each objectnode can operate all volumes in the entire cluster. The
objectnode will load the volume and initialize the related ExtentClient
object. ExtentClient uses a global object pool to optimize memory. This
causes the objectnode to repeatedly create a global object pool during
operation. There is a risk of memory overflow.
The object pool in the ExtentClient is adjusted to be initialized by the
init () method to solve the problem of repeated creation.

This implements ReadDir for fuse.

In order to save current position of readdir, a map DirContexts is
introduced in `Dir struct'. Key Value pair (fuse.HandleID,
DirContext) is created and saved in DirContexts when readdir
starts, and is removed when parent directory is closed.

ReadDir reads a number of dirents from current position, thus a
DirContext, based on ReadDirLimit. After that, a new position
is saved in the same DirContext.

Meta node checks the dentry file mode when dealing with CreateDentry
request if the target dentry already exists to avoid files replacement
with different types, i.e. rename a regular file to overwrite a
directory. However, file mode contains permission bits as well as file
type bits. And we certainly do not want permissions involved in such
situation. So mask the file mode to compare file type bits only.

Some clients (e.g. docker registry) send a get to fetch the whole file
by specifying `bytes=0-` as the range. In this case, ChubaoFS will set
the range to 0-0 and the `Content-Length` to 1 (upper - lower + 1). It
will then error out when writing the object, since it will write more
than the specified `Content-Length`.

As a simple fix, we can treat a rangeUpper of 0 the same as max, which
should result in correct behavior.

The synchronization process now includes synchronizing the ""verlist"". If there is a difference in version numbers,
the client and metanode will mutually push the latest ""verlist"" to each other.
Client writes will have increased retries to carry the ""verlist"".
The purpose of all this is to ensure that the metanode obtains the latest and most comprehensive data,
reducing the possibility of missing data during individual Verseq pushes.

To make it simple, packet of randomWriteVer from client always contains verlist
VerList in dataNode not persist

This update also optimized the message synchronization logic in the process, adopting an asynchronous approach using channels to handle it.

When ETag is stored, it is versioned by encoding, which can make
the file system interface and object storage interface more closely
integrated.

Referring to the Amazon AWS S3 Developer Guide:
""Amazon S3 response includes an ETag that uniquely identifies the
combined object data. This ETag will not necessarily be an MD5 hash
of the object data.""

When a new object is written to ChubaoFS through the object storage
interface, ChubaoFS calculates the ETag value for it, and uses the
modification time of the object as its version information when
encoding and storing.

If this file is modified by the file system interface, the ETag of
this file will be invalid because the version information will be
inconsistent with modification time.

After the object storage interface finds that the ETag is invalid,
it will automatically generate a new ETag matching its modification
time.

Added compatibility with 1.5 version of credential information for

In version 1.5, each volume has its own access key, which is stored
in the view information center of the volume to which it belongs.

In version 2.0, user security and authorization are added. Each user
has their own access key, and users can use this access key to operate
all their own volumes.

Increase the compatibility with the old version authentication method
to reduce the impact of online version 1.5 cluster upgrade to 2.0 on
online services.

The BatchInodeGet will send requests to all the meta partitions.
However, as the number of meta partitions rises, the overhead for a *ls*
operation increases. So it is better to filter the target meta
partitions ahead. But this does not have to be very accurate since the
results of BatchInodeGet are used only for caches, and an InodeGet will
be issued upon cache miss.

Introduce read and write IOPS rate limit feature which can be changed
during runtime with the following http requests through ""profPort""
specified in the config file. For example:

curl -s ""http://localhost:10095/rate/get""
curl -s ""http://localhost:10095/rage/set?write=800&read=800""
curl -s ""http://localhost:10095/rage/set?write=-1""
curl -s ""http://localhost:10095/rage/set?read=-1""

Note that write and read rate limit can be set together or seperately,
and a negative value indicates that rate limit is unlimited. By default
it is unlimited if not specified.

There might be stale discard extents records left in the stream writer.

When a file is truncated less than the discard extents, those discard
extents records are not removed from the stream writer's extent cache.
So next time, when you write to this file range, the client will get a
""conflict extents error"", because the client is expecting to overwrite
and discard these extent keys, but actually they are no such extent keys
in meta node since they were already truncated.

When creating a file, the client will create inode first and then send a
create dentry request. If create dentry request fails due to a net
error (e.g. send the request to metanode but timed out when getting
response), there is a tiny chance that the dentry is created
successfully on metanode. Thus we cannot unlink the inode created
previously because we would rather leave the orphan inode than create
an orphan dentry.

Since jacobasa fuse package uses a fixed-size memory pool for out
messages, it is important to tell fuse kernel module what the maximum
read size is. Otherwise, a large read will cause a panic.

However, max readahead size can only affect buffered read. The kernel
might still send a large directIO read in spite of the max readahead
size. We need to specify ""max_read"" option during mount.

However, the auth key is generated according to the user name which
leads to mount failure when getting volume info from master.

To reproduce:

1. create a volume named V with owner A.
2. authorize user B the rw permission to V.
3. mount V using user B with access and secret key.

The mount would fail.

This commit will not check owner auth key when using access key to
mount.
