 *        - increased dumping of logfile by factor 5 / as long as we still have memory left, you can increase logbuflen from 100 to 1000 to increase transfer speed from approx. 16 to 18 kB/s
 *        - adjusted burner activity monitoring based on broadcast messages for Brötje systems
 *        - removed definement PROGNR_5895 because so far, it has only disabled an ENUM definition.
 *        - removed definement PROGNR_6030 because double command ID could be resolved via BROETJE / non-BROETJE definements
 *        - renamed BROETJE_SOB to BROETJE in order to allow for fine-grained distinction between different BROETJE cases (e.g. 6800ff)
 *          This means you have to activate TWO definements when using a Brötje system now: The general BROETJE as well as BROETJE_SOB or BROETJE_BSW.
 *          Have a look at your serial log for parameters 6800 to see which command IDs fit your system and activate one of both accordingly.

An exception was thrown after publishing a json message in mqtt_mode 3.
Apparently a buffer overlow in outBuf was responsible for the exception,
since it did not happen for mqtt_mode 1 or 2, where the messages are
significantly shorter. The refactored function mqtt_sendtoBroker() is
not using outBuf anymore.

Also in the buffer overflow protection of function mqtt_callback(...) 4
bytes were reserved for creating the acknowledgement message from the
original message, but 5 bytes are needed (4 for the ACK_ prefix and one
for the terminating nul character).",5,71,1

 *        - increased dumping of logfile by factor 5 / as long as we still have memory left, you can increase logbuflen from 100 to 1000 to increase transfer speed from approx. 16 to 18 kB/s
 *        - adjusted burner activity monitoring based on broadcast messages for Brötje systems
 *        - removed definement PROGNR_5895 because so far, it has only disabled an ENUM definition.
 *        - removed definement PROGNR_6030 because double command ID could be resolved via BROETJE / non-BROETJE definements
 *        - renamed BROETJE_SOB to BROETJE in order to allow for fine-grained distinction between different BROETJE cases (e.g. 6800ff)
 *          This means you have to activate TWO definements when using a Brötje system now: The general BROETJE as well as BROETJE_SOB or BROETJE_BSW.
 *          Have a look at your serial log for parameters 6800 to see which command IDs fit your system and activate one of both accordingly.
