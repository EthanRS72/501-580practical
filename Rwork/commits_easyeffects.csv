Gtk.FileChooserNative will use a file chooser dialog that is native to
the desktop environment (when supported). It will also work in sandboxed
environments, such as Flatpak.

Mainly this solves the sandbox problem. Users should now be able to
import presets, no matter how they install the application.

Debian based distributions (any others?), deviate from the upstream

Unfortunately the Meson module for python3 can only fetch upstream paths
like purelib.

This fixes that and should, in theory, simplify things for anyone that
might want to build a debian package.

This script automates the additions to release data in the AppStream
metainfo (appdata) file. It eliminates many possible human errors and
ensures the dates are consistent and always based upon the committed timezone.

The process of adding XML data is based on XML Style Sheets. This is
much safer and more reliable than simply using a tool like `sed`.

If the appdata already contains a release that matches the last tagged
version, no action will be taken.

Together all of this means it should be practically impossible for this
tool to accidentally overwrite any other data. Of course, it does
not hurt to first stage or commit any other changes.",16,17,0,0

The initial script had a fundamental issue; the application version and
release dates were based on git tags. Since this script needs to be run
before a release is tagged, that tag will never include an up-to-date
appdata file.

Versions are now parsed from the main meson.build file. It works well
but there is one limitation, the order of the key/value pairs ""version""
and ""meson_version"" matters. If the order of those keys changes this
script would also require adjustments.

Dates are now provided by the `date` command, using the UTC setting.
This offers consistency since it also is not affected by day light
savings.

An added benefit of these changes is that less external commands are
now used.",17,17,0,0

This commit adds settings that make the spectrum view much more useful.

Most importantly, its update frequency is now configurable from 1 to 200
Hz. Additionally, the magnitudes can now be scaled with an exponent:

final_mag = (scale * mag) ^ exponent

This way we can actually visualize what is happening. The defaults are
set so that the original behavior is unchanged, however the sweet spot
is at very different values:

Sampling Freq: 60 Hz (The usual screen refresh rate, no point in going
                      higher than that)
Scale: 1.2
Exponent: 3.0

With these settings, things actually become visible. Scale and exponent
are of course highly dependent on the type of audio material. For added
pleasure, also double the number of points and the height ;-)",28,21,0,0

The recent introduction of debian build files also modified the
documentation in less than ideal ways.

This fix solves this by staying consistent with previous changes that
moved distribution specific instructions to the wiki. Specifically a
wiki page for community maintained distribution packages is introduced
and linked to.

Build instructions is removed altogether since it has long since had a
dedicated wiki page. Some instructions were incomplete anyhow or located
in the wrong section.

Showing incomplete build instructions at the top is bad, because it
decreases the likelihood of a user reading the complete wiki page, thus
missing information. This in turn leads to an increase in support issues.",9,7,0,0

When making a release run update-release-files.sh. Both the AppStream metainfo and changelog files will be updated with release notes.
For this to be useful, the NEWS file should contain correctly formatted release notes. For the next release, a template with correct formatting is added to NEWS each time a release is made.
After running update-release-files.sh, metainfo and changelog should not need to be modified directly to adjust release notes.

Important: this script is meant to be run at each release. If you do not, it might produce incorrect or confusing results.
Also, reusing old version numbers for new releases might cause problems.

Metainfo is used in GNOME Software and KDE Discover to show release info.
Changelog is a user-facing markdown file explictly mentioned in the readme.

Update/generate metainfo using appstreamcli news-to-metainfo.
Update/generate markdown changelog file using script that converts from the NEWS file.

NEWS is in util/ since formatted markdown is thought to be a more readable format. Also, there is no need to present both a CHANGELOG and NEWS file to users reading the README.

Reuses work from add-metainfo-release.sh originally from 04bd3e968f7e0ba79b9672882590affe445dc330

1. Update version number in meson.build
2. Run update-release-files.sh script
3. Commit, tag and push to GitHub",58,57,0,0

The LSP plugin collection uses a very restrictive license, that may not
even be considered open source (according to the OSI definition). On top
of this the recently added Expander plugin is currently proprietary.

In order to provide both the Expander and Delay plugins an extension
(com.github.wwmm.pulseeffects.plugin.lsp-plugins) has been added to
flathub. This solves the incompatibility with the GPL and makes it
optional if users don't want to install proprietary plugins.

The new extension is provided for x86_64 and i386. ARM is not supported,
because upstream does not provide any binaries.",21,15,0,0

This ended up being rather boringly straight-forward
after figuring out https://github.com/wwmm/easyeffects/pull/1622.
I started by fully copying the `Compressor` effect,
which is also LSP-based, and is pretty modern,
and then changed things.

The `Sidechain`/`Sidechain Filters` tabs are exactly identical
as they are in the `Compressor`, and in general most of the code
is rather exactly identical to `Compressor`.
Seems like some common boilerplate could/should be extracted.

I'm sure i've missed something, but this is basically it.

It might be not convenient for the ordinary user to find pulseeffects application from KDE/Gnome. I suggest we emphasize that PulseEffects is equalizer mostly. Eventually we will benefit once PulseEffects becomes a part of default set of applications installed with major distributions. Users will try to type in ""equalizer"" and will be able to find PulseEffects because ""PulseEffects"" is too technical (relates to pulseaudio), not everyone will know it / remember it.",18,11,0,0

Add support for the meson build system and restructure how data files
is stored in the repository.

Meson has the advantage over setuptools that it will automatically
install all files to the correct locations for the respective operating
system or distribution. No more manual copying of files post build.

Supporting AppStream appdata, including translations is very complicated
without a native build system. By using Meson it is possible to
translate both the application, desktop entry, appdata and even the
gschema files, in a single PO file. This means a much simpler workflow
for translators.

The desktop entry file is renamed according to the freedesktop, desktop
entry specification, (using the ""reverse DNS"" convention). This is
required to support certain tags in AppStream appdata and remves the
need to rename it at build time (Flatpak).",8,5,0,0

This data is currently impractical, and even less practical to translate.

Since PulseEffects does very rapid releases, there is little time to
write proper, easy to read, release descriptions.

Another related problem is translations. There is no window of time for
translators to localize this data. This data could be marked so that it
is not translatable, but some meson or xgettext issues seem to prevent
this from working.

If this data is wanted in the future, simply revert this commit.
