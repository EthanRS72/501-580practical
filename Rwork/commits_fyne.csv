go-list without a given module/package tries to analyze the module
at the current directory. If the current directory's module doesn't
have any Go files and is empty, go-list fails. This is the cause
of the problem that gomobile-init fails if the current directory
is such module.

This CL fixes this issue by giving an arbitrary standard library
when executing go-list.

This CL is a pure refactoring. This removes a global variable ctx,
which is a build.Default.

Before this change, ctx was used to keep build tags and its state
affected go command executions. As the variable is mutable, the
code was not readable.

This changes introduces another global variable buildTags instead,
but this is more consistent with other build flags, and this is
immutable.

The problem
-----------

radial gradients:
The center of a circle with diameter 4 is at (2,2). This is not the center
of the pixel at the coordinates (2,2) because the pixel coordinates are the
top left corner of the pixel's square. Therefore the center of pixel (2,2)
is at (2.5,2.5). The same goes for all other pixels.

linear gradients:
Analogous to the radial gradients the distance of a pixel to an edge is not
x or (w-1)-x or y or (h-1)-y but x+0.5 or w-(x+0.5) or y+0.5 or h-(y+0.5).

The solution
------------

The distance computation now uses the pixel center
(pixel coordinate + (0.5,0.5)) for computation.
Radial gradients are now centred properly.
Linear gradients don't need to reduce the width or height anymore.",75,21,0

- Fixes the last remaining cases of #2220 that I've found, in buttonColor() and in button.go's newButtonTapAnimation().
- Adds a math-based test which uses an alternate way of calculating the same blending operation to test buttonRenderer's hover code against (TestButton_Hover_Math in button_internal_test.go).
- Updates the hover test image used by button_test.go's TestButton_Hover()
- Updates a bunch of hover-related tests so that they look for the corrected output from buttonColor(), by updating the four XML files and one image that they test against.

* Adding form dialog that validates form items

 - Added an example to the demo tutorials
 - Relies on the same dialog testing as already existed

* Formatting and organizing imports

* Adding documentation to ShowFormDialog too

* Changed Goland to use goimport style import organization

* Dropping case on demo dialog errors and adding UX friendly prefix

* Moving away from direct validation error reporting

 - Confirm button enabled state will be toggled based on validation result
 - Formatting fix

* Removing extraneous comments and fixing doc comments

* Refactoring to enable testing

 - There's a fair bit of logic in this factory function now, so I wanted to cover the edge states.

* Moving form dialog to its own file at @jacalz request

 - Renamed test file to make it clear what's being tested.
 - Started on FormDialog struct

* Reworking testing to use the FormDialog struct

 - Thanks, @jacalz!

* Adding missing type doc

* Removing unused const

* Applying review feedback

 - Extracting method for validating items that also serves as a validation edge state handler
 - This simplifies testing too
 - Making the item creation loop more efficient
 - Using validation.NewRegexp in examples

* Forgot to change 'canValidate' to 'ok' here too.

* Update dialog/form.go

Using better FormDialog doc verbiage.

Co-authored-by: Jacob <Jacalz@users.noreply.github.com>

* Inlining NewRegexp

* Cleaning up validateItems

* Applying review feedback

* Forgot to change this to return an exposed type

This CL is a pure refactoring. This removes a global variable ctx,
which is a build.Default.

Before this change, ctx was used to keep build tags and its state
affected go command executions. As the variable is mutable, the
code was not readable.

This changes introduces another global variable buildTags instead,
but this is more consistent with other build flags, and this is
immutable.

This change adds a RWMutex to synchronize access to the fileDialog.data file list.
The refreshDir function clears and rebuilds fileDialog.data, meanwhile, several other functions are indexing into it.
This allowed for scenarios where fileDialog.data was either nil or smaller than expected when indexing into it.

Issue #1941

Gboard always sends backspace events, however, other keyboards only send
or enable the backspace based on the state of the textentry. Also, some
don't send the event, but instead modify the textentry text itself.

This edits the entry to always show some text, a zero. This way the
keyboards kill be able to edit/backspace characters. The textChanged
then sends a backspace Key Event to the Go code.

In the case of using a keyboard (such as Gboard) that sends its own
backspace event, we need a way to stop processing of two deletes (the
one Gboard sends, and the one textChanged sends). A backspaceDelay timer
is used to only process backspaces a certain time (50ms) apart.",109,39,0

Note that I have veered much more towards @toaster 's (Tilo) proposal
than I had originally. My change of heart is documented in the relevant
proposal here:

 https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/wiki/Proposal%3A-The-Fyne-URI-Philosophy

I have decided not to implement URINotListable on the basis that
URIOperationImpossible already encompasses it's purpose, and
additionally I want to encourage people to use Listable() rather than
just trying to List() and then checking the error.

I decided to move List and Listable() into the Repository interface,
though developers can always throw URIOperatioNotSupported if they are
impossible to implement. I could be convinced to move them into their
own ListableRepository interface to be optionally registered, but to
keep them together (since you cannot have one without the other). This
was discussed a little bit, but I am on the fence.

Since I decided to go with more of Tilo's approach, I did not add Move()
or Duplicate(). If folks have opinions on using these names versus
Rename() and Copy(), please add them on the PR.",89,35,0

It seems like we (and many other projects but that's just speculation) are moving away from using new() when creating structs (using new(int) still is useful). My opinion is that t is a lot clearer to create the struct directly, without using new(), and we also get direct field access which can decrease inlining costs and sometimes allow the compiler to optimize things a bit more. This changes a few places where it seemed to make sense to not use new().",31,66,1

Initial implementation was by @dweymouth over at https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne-x/pull/56. This PR includes that work plus selection support and some of the improvements that I have done (see https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne-x/pull/61 and https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne-x/compare/master...Jacalz:gridwrap-selection?expand=1).

This was done as a PR directly to Fyne and not fyne-x as the `.super()` call from `widget.BaseWidget` wasn't public and not using it made the selection work bad. All of the changes in this PR compared to the widget in fyne-x can be found here: https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne-x/compare/master...Jacalz:gridwrap-selection?expand=1

This applies the per-allocation optimization to a few more places. There are probably a few more that could be added but this is a good step forward in the meantime, fixing the more straight-forward cases.

In summary, it boils down to:
- Setting the objects in accordion went from (a total time over three calls) `10.022µs` to `1.567µs` (6.4x faster). Might be even faster du to further allocation optimisations done after these measurements.- Adding all objects in CreateRenderer of radio_group went from (a total time over four calls) `2.327µs` to `1.486µs` (1.5x faster).
- Creating the icon strings in fyne_demo went from `11.444µs` to `3.566µs` (3.2x faster).",78,33,0

Mainly there was two problems:
- the first and probably the main bug is that sometimes the app closes too early without waiting for the goroutines that were called in [fireChange()](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/blob/3814a66f75ff5d24be6fa107f1dfb9c4faa859b1/internal/preferences.go#L69) and one of those goroutines is the one that calls [save()](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/blob/3814a66f75ff5d24be6fa107f1dfb9c4faa859b1/app/preferences.go#L35) an easy fix was to implement the sync.WaitGroup functionality which i expected to work just fine, yet it didn't due to
- the second issue which was a misuse of the lockers, in lines [70 and 71](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/blob/3814a66f75ff5d24be6fa107f1dfb9c4faa859b1/internal/preferences.go#L70-L71) are using Lock() and after that there are goroutines that are expected to read the same struct, well they won't be able to because Lock() only allows one goroutine (read/write) at a time and in fact the goroutines functions that were thought are being executed were actually not, they were just in stuck position waiting for the fireChange() to return (and to trigger it's defer function to Unlock()) so all those go l() were only waiting for fireChange() to return then get executed, well after the fix (1) the function will never return because it's waiting for the goroutines functions which will never work either because they are waiting for fireChange() ,,, deadlock ; the fix was pretty clear is to use RLock() instead of Lock() that way, where multiple goroutines can read(but not write) the struct and the fireChange() will only returns after all the goroutines are done and only after that the app will close

Applies to Label, Hyperlink, and Entry

There are three text wrapping modes;
- TextWrapOff (default)
  - Widgets are expanded to fit the text.
  - Consistent with previous behaviour.
- TextTruncate
  - Text longer than the widget's width is not displayed.
  - An ellipsis is NOT added if text gets truncated, although this
    should be considered for future (perhaps TextTruncateEllipsis).
- TextWrapBreak
  - Text longer than the widget's width is wrapped onto the next line.
  - A hyphen is NOT added if a word gets broken, although this
    should be considered for future (perhaps TextWrapOnHypenate).
- TextWrapWord
  - Text longer than the widget's width is wrapped onto the next line.
  - Text is broken on word boundaries (spaces) to avoid breaking words.
  - Text without word boundaries is broken the same as TextWrapBreak.

Calling a function on the main thread is a common operation
in Go's GUI programming. For instance, the runOnMain must
be called at each render loop.

Previously, the runOnMain allocates a done channel to wait
for a scheduled call on the main thread to complete and thus
can produce the amount of work and awake the garbage collector
quite often. Instead of allocating a channel for each call
on the main thread, this change uses a channel pool and
optimizes this particular case.

Aside, the calls on the draw thread can also be optimized and
use the same channel pool.

- For KDE, read the kdeglobals file and calculate the brightness if the
  theme is not the standard one - this method can also be applied for
  older Gnome version reading GTK themes, but is this useful?
- Theme change detection:
    - Gnome: connect to dbus and wait for theme change
    - KDE, no idea at this time, but switching from KDE to Gnome has
      changed the Gnome theme... So maybe KDE is using dbus too.",97,57,1

This PR cleans up some of the maps that are used in the internal/driver/glfw/window_*.go files.

 - De-duplicate a some code between desktop and goxjs.
 - Remove trivial keyCodeMapASCII in favour of a function with simple rune value manipulation.
 - Replace keyCodeMap (it was basically just checking mapping ""a"" to ""a"" to check if it existed) with a switch statement instead. Benchmark shows about a 3x improvement.
 - Use a function for keyNameMap instead. Allows for some clever ASCII value mappings in intervals.",89,54,1

Mainly there was two problems:
- the first and probably the main bug is that sometimes the app closes too early without waiting for the goroutines that were called in [fireChange()](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/blob/3814a66f75ff5d24be6fa107f1dfb9c4faa859b1/internal/preferences.go#L69) and one of those goroutines is the one that calls [save()](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/blob/3814a66f75ff5d24be6fa107f1dfb9c4faa859b1/app/preferences.go#L35) an easy fix was to implement the sync.WaitGroup functionality which i expected to work just fine, yet it didn't due to
- the second issue which was a misuse of the lockers, in lines [70 and 71](https://github.com/fyne-io/fyne/blob/3814a66f75ff5d24be6fa107f1dfb9c4faa859b1/internal/preferences.go#L70-L71) are using Lock() and after that there are goroutines that are expected to read the same struct, well they won't be able to because Lock() only allows one goroutine (read/write) at a time and in fact the goroutines functions that were thought are being executed were actually not, they were just in stuck position waiting for the fireChange() to return (and to trigger it's defer function to Unlock()) so all those go l() were only waiting for fireChange() to return then get executed, well after the fix (1) the function will never return because it's waiting for the goroutines functions which will never work either because they are waiting for fireChange() ,,, deadlock ; the fix was pretty clear is to use RLock() instead of Lock() that way, where multiple goroutines can read(but not write) the struct and the fireChange() will only returns after all the goroutines are done and only after that the app will close

Before the removal of background colors, the refresh
on a menu item for updating the background color
was not really necessary because the menu refresh
already triggered the repaint of the menu (sub)tree.

With the background being normal canvas objects,
two errors in the refresh of the items revealed
which were hard to tackle:
- the previously active item was refreshed _before_
  it was deactivated
  -> the background color did not change
- the newly active item was not refreshed at all
  -> the background color did not change

there background to active when becoming inactive

The gopls team has received reports of high memory usage in the Fyne
project. The problem is the very large byte slice literals in the theme
package, which consume about 200MiB for the AST and another 200-400 for
type information.

While this is obviously a deficiency in gopls, it's not easy to fix
while maintaining full functionality. Changing the byte slices to
strings is very easy.

As a further optimization, it might be good to change them to be *used*
as strings, since byte slices have to live on the heap and therefore
consume actual memory, whereas strings can be left on disk until
accessed.",75,34,0
