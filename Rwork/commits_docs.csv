* dumpling-overview: Add info about how to install with TiUP

Currently we point users to: https://docs.pingcap.com/tidb/stable/download-ecosystem-tools#dumpling

However for this the user needs to:
- Figure out what version he/she wants to download
- Then based on that construct the URL
- Download the file
- Extract/install dumpling

TiUP is making this easier, so best to use that instead. This is also
more consistent with other tools.
