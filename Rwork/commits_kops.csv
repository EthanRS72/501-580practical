This fixes an issue where kops picks the last server group found on
OpenStack instead of the right one when getting the cloud groups.

For example, lets assume that kops created those server groups and they are returned in the order as shown here by the OpenStack API:

```
cluster-name-bastion
cluster-name-cp-0
cluster-name-worker
````

Now kops looks for nodes associated with the IG ""bastion"" and the
expected behavior would be that it ends up using ""cluster-name-bastion"".
However, it will actually end up  associating the cloud group with the
last server group, which is in this case ""cluster-name-worker"" due to
the reference switching to the last item when the loop is done.

In the worst case this could lead to kops deleting the wrong instances
when deleting an IG.

Not using the server group as a ""by reference"" argument when building
the cloud group fixes this behavior.",85,69,1

The image pushing postsubmit job [0] is one step closer to succeeding.

It currently fails because when the builder image uploads the kops directory to GCS for to be consumed by GCB, it excludes the .git directory [1].

This causes the job to fail because `make kops-controller-push` uses bazel which runs get_workspace_status.sh which aborts if the git commands fail.

The prow job doesnt contain much output but the GCB logs can be seen in GCS [2].

This PR removes the dependency on git commands.
I dont think any of the logic in the script will change because we already set VERSION [3] which is the only variable in get_workspace_status.sh that depends on git commands and is used to build and push the kops controller image.

We identify the external manifests by checking for our labels.
Currently that label is kOps specific, and we'll likely have to evolve
that to something ecosystem-netural.

We only support the GCE CCM addon and the kopeio-networking addon at
first.

For the GCE CCM addon, we need to replace the arguments, in particular
we likely need the Pod CIDR.  Here we need to work with the GCE CCM to
find a mechanism that can allow some of these flags to be communicated
via a more extensible mechanism (env vars or config maps, likely,
though possibly CRDs).

This is all behind the ClusterAddons feature flag at the moment, so we
can figure this out with other projects safely.

>Pin actions to a full length commit SHA

>Pinning an action to a full length commit SHA is currently the only way to use an action as an immutable release. Pinning to a particular SHA helps mitigate the risk of a bad actor adding a backdoor to the action's repository, as they would need to generate a SHA-1 collision for a valid Git object payload.

This PR formalizes the options and generates a client certificate on their behalf (note, the server{.cert,key} can no longer be used post 1.7 as the certificate usage is checked i.e. it's not using a client cert). The users now only need to add anonymousAuth: false to enable secure api to kubelet. I'd like to make this default to all new builds i'm not sure where to place it.

When booting a cluster with `--networking=cni`, `dns-controller` will
not start due to the master node being _tainted_ as ""network unreachable"".
This adds an extra step when managing your own CNI setup, having to SSH
into a master and publish the CNI manifests from there.

This commit adds tolerance and configuration that allows `dns-controller`
pod to start when running with `--networking=cni`, properly creating the
DNS records so the operator can remotely publish the CNI and extra
manifests to have a full working cluster.

This also removes the dependency on `kube-proxy`, by adding the
`KUBERNETES_SERVICE_HOST` environment variable, bypassing `kube-proxy`
when disabled.

Presumably, as a side-effect, this change also allows for
""host network only"" clusters to work.

In the ValidationError struct, there is a field to identify the instance group to

To acheive this, we create a node to instance group mapping in ValidateNodes.
This node to instance group mapping is used in collectPodFailures to identify the
pod instance group by using the pod's hostIp field.

Go modules require the v prefix [0], and k/k also tags with the v prefix [1]

We have some inconsistent tags already, for 1.11.0 we have tags of both `1.11.0` and `v1.11.0` which is the most recent tag with the prefix.
This is also why 1.11.0 is the default version imported by `go get`:

```
go get -v k8s.io/kops
go: downloading k8s.io/kops v1.11.0
```

and the latest version in `go list`:

```
go list -m -versions k8s.io/kops
k8s.io/kops v1.4.0-alpha.1 v1.4.0 v1.4.1 v1.4.2 v1.4.3 v1.4.4 v1.10.0 v1.11.0
```

I'm proposing we switch to only tagging with the v prefix. I'm only updating the actual git tag and not the entire version string used throughout kops due to its larger impact:

* Output by `kops version`
* Public URLs for kops assets
* Protokube tag

I'm hoping this is the least invasive way we can make this change.
If we think advanced notice is required, we could tag with both formats for a number of releases before tagging only with the v prefix.

The snafu here is that we weren't really using namespaces previously.
Namespaces do seem to be the primary RBAC scoping mechanism though, so
we start using them with the real clientset.

The namespace is currently inferred from the cluster name.  We map dots
to dashes, because of namespace limitations, which could yield
collisions, but we'll deal with this by simply preventing users from

As per Lance Robson's message in Slack,
https://kubernetes.slack.com/archives/C3QUFP0QM/p1537959279000100?thread_ts=1537951563.000100&cid=C3QUFP0QM
above 50-100 nodes Calico recommends usage of BGP route reflectors:
> Clearly I'm not impartial here, but I can tell you that we test Calico to 5K
>  nodes.
> We recommend BGP route reflectors once you go above ~50-100 nodes (we test up
>  to 100 nodes without RRs).  The reason for RRs is that by default calico sets up
>  BGP connections in a full mesh - clearly the number of connections will scale as
>  the number of nodes squared.  With RRs, the number of BGP connections scales
>  linearly with nodes - but then you have to manage the RRs too.
> The next version of Calico (v3.3 - code is in master already, but not heavily
>  tested yet) will bring a feature to make RRs much easier to deploy - just
>  annotate a few nodes and they become RRs.

In 0.3.x, the secure kubelet port with auth is enabled by default. Use
of the insecure port is deprecated and may even be removed as soon as
the next release. See:
* https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server/releases/tag/v0.3.0
* https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server/releases/tag/v0.3.1

That said, metrics-server now uses webhook authentication so kubelet
would need webhook authentication enabled (which we don’t). This flag
enables, that serviceaccount tokens to be used to authenticate against
the kubelet: See:
* https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/webhook/

* https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/issues/5176#issuecomment-402454053
* https://github.com/kubernetes-incubator/metrics-server/issues/175

Currently, even if we were to use certificates, this provides a
challenge since metrics server will generate it’s own self-signed
certificates since we don’t set `--tls-cert-file` and
`--tls-private-key-file`. Related:

As described here: https://github.com/weaveworks/weave/blob/ce9c5162bd94018ad5caca2c914cb5780727147c/site/kubernetes/kube-addon.md
Setting the CONN_LIMIT environment variable controls this setting. Adding a field in the
WeaveNetworkingSpec and adding the env var to the associated templates lets users
have clusters larger than 30 nodes and still use weave's peer discovery

The weave authors have indicated that 100 is not an unreasonable setting.

* Changed Dockerfile base image to debian for systemctl and bash.
* Added autodetect of AWS ec2 instanceclass p2, p3, g3.
* For each detected instance class, added the installation of the proper driver
  according to the specific NVIDIA hardware.
  - G3 instance types require Nvidia Grid Series/Grid K520 drivers
  - P2 instance types require Nvidia Tesla K-Series drivers
  - P3 instance types require Nvidia Tesla V-Series drivers
* Set custom nvidia-smi configurations according to nvidia hardware per ec2
  instanceclass, according to the AWS GPU optimization document.
* Added the installation and patches of the latest cuda 9.1 libraries.
* Added restart of kubelet on kube node at end of successful hook run, thereby
  fixing a race condition where kubelet would start before the Nvidia drivers
  were loaded, thus not allowing kubernetes to detect GPUS on the kube node.
* Ensured build of nvidia drivers used same gcc version as that which built
  default kops kernel.
* Fixed issue where *every* run of this container would download all the NVIDIA
  drivers + cuda libs (1GB+), by caching the files on the kube node.
* Fixed issue where after reboot, subsequent runs of this script would fail
  because mknod would try to create a previously-created device node and fail.
  This previously caused download loop as systemd perpetually restarted the
  unit upon failure.
* Tested with p2.xlarge, p3.2xlarge, and g3.4xlarge",447,21,0

When a struct contains a default value, it is not present in the
serialized output attached to request bodies sent to GCP. In the case
that a user wishes to explicitly set the `AutoCreateSubnetworks` field
to `false`, the request sent to GCP does not contain this directive, and
the network is provisioned with the default of `true`.

Explicitly specify that the `false` value should be present on the
request sent to the GCP API, making use of the `ForceSendFields` field
in the requset struct.

The migration was first made in 1.16.0-alpha.1, so that means 2 releases have been out that set the replicas to zero.
This removal negatively impacts anyone that created a cluster from kops HEAD between 1.15.0 and 1.16.0-alpha.1, and then upgraded kops directly to the 1.16.0 release that includes this commit, without having first upgraded to either of the alphas.

That seems like a reasonably small enough audience that this is safe to remove now.

We do smart service restarting: we restart the service if a dependency

service manifest itself in the calculation, which was an error.

The bug only exposed itself though when we downloaded and updated
docker, e.g. when running k8s 1.5 with a 1.4 image.  We would write the
env file early (no dependencies), then we would download docker and
install it, and then we would write the service manifest.  But if docker
had been started during this interval (e.g. by protokube), then we would
see that docker had been started after the dependencies (the env file),
and not restart it.  When we consider the manifest file also, things
work as intended.

Sometimes we see the following error during a rolling update:

It's possible that the EC2 instance to have disappeared by the time it
was detached (it may have been a spot instance for example)

In any case, we can't do much when we do not find an instance id, and
throwing this error during the update is not very user friendly.

As such, we can simply report and tolerate this problem instead of

According to the upgrade guide [0] resource names cannot start with digits.
Currently both routes and VPC CIDR associations start with digits, so this adds prefixes to them so that they are valid resource identifiers in 0.12.

This is a significant change because on its own, terraform will destroy and recreate the route which impact the cluster networking.
To avoid this, existing clusters this will require moving the resources within the terraform state prior to the next `apply`.

```
kops update cluster --target terraform --out ./
terraform state mv aws_route.0-0-0-0--0 aws_route.route-0-0-0-0--0 # repeat for all aws_route resources
terraform plan
terraform apply
```

The exact terraform state command may vary depending on how Kops' terraform output is used.
See the command documentation [1] for more details.
Always run a terraform plan first to ensure the `aws_route` and `aws_vpc_ipv4_cidr_block_association` resources are not getting recreated.

Due to the potential impact, this notice should be very prominant in the Kops release notes

Introduce a new ""encapsulationMode"" field in Calico's portion of the
Cluster specification to allow switching between the the IP-in-IP and
VXLAN encapsulation protocols. For now, we accept the values ""ipip""
and ""vxlan,"" and forgo a possible ""none"" value that would disable
encapsulation altogether (at least for the default Calico IP pool).

Augment the default-populating procedure for Calico to take this field
into account when deciding both which networking backend to use and
whether to use IP-in-IP or VXLAN encapsulation for the default IP
pool. Note that these values supplied for the ""CALICO_IPV4POOL_IPIP""
and ""CALICO_IPV4POOL_VXLAN"" environment variables in the ""calico-node""
DaemonSet pod spec only matter for creating the ""default"" IPPool pool
object when no such objects already exist.

Generalize the documentation for the ""crossSubnet"" field to cover
environments more broad than just AWS, as Calico can employ this
selective encapsulation in any environment in which it can detect
boundaries between subnets.",183,53,1

protokube, after we had mounted the disks.  This helped avoid e.g. the
apiserver going into backoff waiting for etcd.

However, this no longer achieves anything with etcd-manager - nothing
happens on this front until after we start the kubelet anyway.

Doing this both takes protokube out of the dependency sequence here
(slightly faster boot time), but also removes the systemd dependency
from the protokube image.  (So we can get a smaller image, perhaps
even distroless)",229,47,1

This file is used by the push-to-staging postsubmit job that builds images and pushes them to a staging repo.
When it was originally added, my theory for why the job was failing [0] is that we were only uploading the ci/postsubmit/push-to-staging directory to GCS for use in cloudbuild, when in reality we need to push the entire kops repo so it can run `make kops-controller-push`.

A while back I had updated the job to use the repo root but hadnt created the cloudbuild.yaml file there yet, so instead we've been getting a cloudbuild.yaml not found error [1].

This moves the cloudbuild.yaml into the repo root so that the current job configuration will recognize it and hopefully be able to run `make kops-controller-push` in GCB.

This is a follow-on to #8868; I believe the intent of that was to
expose the option to do more (or fewer) retries.

We previously had a single retry to prevent flapping; this basically
unifies the previous behaviour with the idea of making it
configurable.

* validate-count=0 effectively turns off validation.

* validate-count=1 will do a single validation, without flapping
  detection.

* validate-count>=2 will require N succesful validations in a row,
waiting ValidateSuccessDuration in between.

A nice side-effect of this is that the tests now explicitly specify
ValidateCount=1 instead of setting ValidateSuccessDuration=0, which
had the side effect of doing the equivalent to ValidateCount=1.",270,46,0

By introducing a few new fields within the Cluster spec's

Balancers (ALBs). It's possible to enable separately use of two kinds
of WAF: WAF Classic and the never version 2-era WAF, the latter of
which bears no distinguishing name.

Retain our default configuration of the AWS Load Balancer Controller

Revert changes

Use a smaller droplet size

Update make file

Add SSH key for DO

Add private key path

update ssh user

Another fix

try with v1.18

use 1.20

Rebase with master

Fix merge issues

Add DO droplet dump support

I'm hoping this allows our e2e tests to dump system logs into the job artifacts for easier troubleshooting

Use root ssh user

use 2 nodes to reduce cost

another minor fix

Skip services test

Increase master size

Skip flaky tests

Remove pod status test that belongs to v1.20

Add do test file and revert changes to make file

Update make file

Include DigitalOcean in the supported provider flags

incorporate review comments

This PR introduces two fixes:
1) Add missing RetryWithBackoff to DeleteInstanceWithID
2) Fix broken retry logic in all other delete functions. In the current implementation, as the first Delete request will almost certainly return nil, the function will return true and the retry will not try again, resulting in assets not getting deleted from OpenStack

Also, the current writeBackoff is pretty aggressive and I introduced a bit less hasty deleteBackoff.

 As per
 https://github.com/kubernetes/dns/commit/3b17e06879a46b2ec5d97105c611a315897fdb48,
 node-local-dns addon is now builded with latest coreDNS base v1.8 and
 that brings great consistency between cache and upstream servers in a
 manner of configuration, metrics name convention, etc.

 So in this commit, we bump node-local-dns image to latest v1.20.0 which
 is build upon latest coreDNS and also add support for overriding this
 field.

This commit exposes kube-apiserver's audit log to the host as a host

PR #1872 gave the ability to users to define a custom log path for the
apiserver to write its audit logs to. Prior to this commit, the log file
would stay within the container's filesystem, and getting access to it from
outside the container was a nuisance.

to read and tail this log from outside the kube-apiserver container.",574,10,0

Docker 1.13 changed how it set up iptables in a way that broke
forwarding.

We previously got away with it because we set the ip_forward sysctl,
which meant that docker wouldn't change the rule.  But if we're using an
image that preinstalled docker, docker might have already reconfigured
iptables before we run, and we didn't set it back.

We now set it back.

Note the feature is isolated and regardless of this PR can still be enabled and used (albeit they will have to implement their own means of token distribution). This PR adds on top of #5253 and provides an authorization service which runs on the masters. The service is responsible for receiving request from nodes (who's identity is verified via a chosen means) and issues a bootstrap token to the node registration. The bootstrap is part of the system:node-bootstrapper group and can request a CSR via that. Note, but turning on NodeAuthorization we also default to using the NodeAdmission controller providing extra security by apply a filter on the requests from a node (i.e. you can't request something that isn't scheduled on the node)

For aws, the nodes are verified in the following manner

the pkcs7 signed identity document available only from the node metadata service is passed in the request.
the instance is checked as running, inside the region, part of the cluster via a tag and then check that the node is not already registered.
assuming everyone is cool a bootstrap token is given (this at present is auto-approval, though think about it I meant add it as an optional thing)
I've tried to break up the commits in logical order make reviewing easier.

- adding the node authorization api specification

- adding the node authorization api specification 5dbf275
- consuming the node authorization api spec in nodeup binary 6e32f24
- adding the options builder to fill in the model
- adding the spec into the bootstrap config
- adding the node authorization service into kops ad5c654. note there is not code cross over, it's a completely independent service and could technically live in another repo
- adding the dependencies for the node authorization service 2e3f279

Node Problem Detector aims to make various node problems visible to
the upstream layers in the cluster management stack. It is a daemon
that runs on each node, detects node problems and reports them to apiserver
so to avoid scheduling new pods on bad nodes and also easily identify
which are the problems on underlying nodes.

In Calico's released versions, when using the eBPF data plane,
containers using host ports cannot respond to connection attempts
correctly. These container receive the packets from the client
forwarded after DNAT, but when they reply, there is no conntrack entry
for the would-be connection, so netfilter drops the reply packets,
preventing the connection from completing. The client never receives
the reply packets. The conntrack entry is missing because Calico
mistakenly attempts to optimize it away.

Work around the problem by disabling the Calico Felix program's
""BPFHostConntrackBypass"" feature. This is a temporary measure until
the Calico maintainers can improve this feature to better handle host
port traffic, preserving these conntrack entries as intended.",87,74,1

Fixed an oops I created in #2494 where log rotation does not function
as expected.

The kube-apiserver first has to rename the existing audit log prior to a new one
being created. Renaming is not possible when the audit file is mounted
directly as the host path. kube-apiserver will return a 'Device or
resource busy' error when it tries to do so. So instead, we mount the
directory of the path instead of the file itself. Also remove the
creation of an empty audit log file as that is no longer necessary for
Docker to mount a directory.

""If an audit log file already exists, Kubernetes appends new audit logs
to that file. Otherwise, Kubernetes creates an audit log file at the
location you specified in audit-log-path. If the audit log file exceeds
the size you specify in audit-log-maxsize, Kubernetes will rename the
current log file by appending the current timestamp on the file name
(before the file extension) and create a new audit log file. Kubernetes
may delete old log files when creating a new log file; you can configure
how many files are retained and how old they can be by specifying the
audit-log-maxbackup and audit-log-maxage options.""

Source: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/debug-application-cluster/audit/

Tested this on Kubernetes 1.6 and with an audit log path specified to
be:
/var/log/kube-apiserver-audit.log

The kube-apiserver container has this mounted:

I made a mistaken assumption in
dde2100a198d300f5a3529f0121f3251ed05a607 that we only had one subnet
per AZ, but as demonstrated in #5587 this was not the case.

What I was trying to achieve was not to include the cluster name, so
for the case of subnets this commit just uses the subnet name from the
cluster spec, which should be unique and stable.  That is hopefully at
least as meaningful.

Thankfully we hadn't released a version with the erroneous naming.

could get it in a short amount of work without just busting apart the
golang:1.6-alpine image to compress the Go layer itself. It's good
enough for what I'm planning to use it for: CI builds.

This commit does the following two changes:

1. Changes the default calico mtu to 8198.
2. Enables setting the mtu explicitly in the config as:
```
  networking:
    calico:
      mtu: 2048
```

Testing done:

1. Created cluster on AWS with networking set to calico. No additional details were provided. Verified that the mtu was set to 8198. Also verified that the FELIX_IPINIPMTU environment variable was set to 8198.
2. Created a cluster explicitly setting the calico mtu to 2048. Verified that the mtu for the 'cali*' interfaces inside the pods was set to 2048. Also, verified that the FELIX_IPINIPMTU environment variable was set to 2048.
3. make test passed.

Starting from Docker 18.09.0, the Docker distribution has been split in
3 packages: the Docker daemon, the Docker CLI, and for containerd.  This
adds a twist to how to upgrade Docker from the base image as the daemon
and CLI packages must be installed at the same time, otherwise dpkg/rpm
will refuse to upgrade (the new CLI is incompatible with the old package
and the daemon can't be installed without first installing the CLI and
the new containerd, so the upgrade MUST happen in a single transaction).

This code change thus adds the possibility to specify additional packages
to install in the same dpkg/yum transaction, such as the Docker CLI and
containerd in nodeup, and the ability to apply the multi-package upgrade
atomically with dpkg/rpm.

We also use this new mechanism for the SELinux policy on RHEL/CentOS.",412,31,0

a) The current implementation use's a static kubelet which doesn't not conform to the Node authorization mode (i.e. system:nodes:<nodename>)
b) As present the kubeconfig is static and reused across all the masters and nodes

The PR firstly introduces the ability for users to use bootstrap tokens and secondly when enabled ensure the kubelets for the masters as have unique usernames.  Note, this PR does not attempt to address the distribution of the bootstrap tokens themselves, that's for cluster admins. One solution for this would be a daemonset on the masters running on hostNetwork and reuse dns-controller to annotated the pods and give as the DNS

Notes:
- the master node do not use bootstrap tokens, instead given they have access to the ca anyhow, we generate certificates for each.
- when bootstrap token is not enabled the behaviour will stay the same; i.e. a kubelet configuration brought down from the store.
- when bootstrap tokens are enabled, the Nodes sit in a timeout loop waiting for the configuration to appear (by third party).
- given the nodeup docker and manifests builders are executed before the kubelet builder, the assumption here is a unit file kicks of a custom container to bootstrap the rest.
- the current firewalls on between the master and nodes are fairly open so no need to open ports between the two
- much of the work was ported from @justinsb PR [here](https://github.com/kubernetes/kops/pull/4134/)
- we add a very presumptuous server and client certificates for use with an authorizer (node-bootstrap-internal.dns_zone)

I do have an additional PR which performs the entire thing. The process being a node_authorizer which runs on the master nodes via a daemonset, the service implements a series of authorizers (i.e. alwaysallow, aws, gce etc). For aws, the process is similar to how vault authorizes nodes [here](https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/auth/aws.html). Nodeup no then calls out to the node_authorizer on bootstrap and provisions the kubelet.",484,23,0

- Resources
We enable users to set their desired capacity for cluster-autoscaler addon.
There are edge cases, especially in big clusters, where autoscaler needs
to reconcile a large number of objects thus may need increased memory or
increased cpu to avoid saturation.

- Metrics
Cluster autoscaler provides valuable insights for monitoring capacity
allocation and scheduling aspects of a cluster. In this commit, we
add proper annotation on deployment to enable Prometheus scrape metrics.

We also bump patch version of container images.

As of k8s 1.16, the node-role label is protected for security reasons.
We will introduce a controller to set those labels generically.
However, we need these labels to run the controller (only) on master
nodes.

To solve this bootstrapping problem, we use protokube to apply the
master role node labels to the master node only.  This isn't a
security problem because we assume that protokube on the master is
highly trusted - we are still administering labels centrally.

Then kops-controller can use this label to target the master nodes,
and run a central label controller.",338,38,0

If the instance restarted but lost the volume mount, there might be a
short or indefinite delay before protokube can mount the volume again.
But the etcd manifest would probably still be in
/etc/kubernetes/manifests from the previous run.

To ensure that kubelet doesn't run etcd until the volume is actually
mounted, we use a symlink to a directory on the volume itself.  Thus
kubelet can't start etcd until we put the volume there.  We can also
delete the symlink before mounting, so we have full control.

We need a region to start from to make AWS calls.  us-east-1 works for
most credentials, but not for cn-north-1 credentials.  Instead, we get
the current region from metadata when running on EC2; and we continue
to fall-back to us-east-1.

For CLI commands (kops) the user will still have to set AWS_REGION,
but for system binaries (nodeup, etcd-manager), this should default
appropriately.

Note that the region doesn't have to be the actual region of the
bucket, just a region we can access.

Testing done:
1. kops cluster create goes through fine and creates the link cloned VM for the master and worker. Verified that it creates the snapshot on the template VM if it does not exists before creating a link cloned VM. In case the snapshot exists, it uses it to create the link cloned VM.

Previously with --wait if a cluster successfully validated and then a subsequent validation failed
(perhaps due to a new critical pod being scheduled and not being ready) we would previously fail the `validate cluster` command immediately.

This will now reset the success counter that approaches --count, allowing validation attempts to continue until we timeout from --wait.

I'm hoping this fixes prow job failures like this: https://prow.k8s.io/view/gs/kubernetes-jenkins/logs/e2e-kops-grid-u1804-k18-containerd/1370875829445201920

where `kops validate cluster --count 10 --wait 15m` was invoked at `23:15:48` but exited with failure at `23:22:59`.
In my opinion, `kops validate cluster --count 10 --wait 15m` should only ever exit with failure if the 15 minute timeout has been reached.",155,56,1

Use the last component of the self-url for a router's region, rather
than the full URL.

Explicitly set the boolean pointer for `HasExternalIP` if the interface
attached to the instance does not have an access config (i.e. has no
public internet access).

Without this patch, both the router and instance template show pending
updates, neither of which can be applied as both are immutable
resources.

As of the NVIDIA Container Toolkit v1.6.0 release the nvidia-container-toolkit

This change installs the nvidia-container-toolkit package directly instead.

Note that the nvidia-container-runtime binary is included in this package.

Extending the current implementation of toolbox template to include multiple files and snippets. Note, i've removed the requirements for defaults as I think people should be forced to specifically pass them.

- fixing the vetting iseues to the method YamlToJson -> YAMLToJSON
- adding a safety check to ensure templates don't reference an unknown value
- extending the unit test to ensure the above works on main and snippets
- include the ability to specify multiple configuration files, useful for common.yaml and prod.yaml etc

Requested Changes - Toolbox Templating

Added the requested changes

- moved the templater into it's own package rather than using base util
- moved to using the sprig library for additional template function
- @note: i couldn't find a native way in sprig to do snippets, also the i've overloaded the indent as it appears to do the indent on all lines rather than on the newline, meaning i'd have to shift my first line back by the indent to get it to work, which seems ugly",753,14,0
