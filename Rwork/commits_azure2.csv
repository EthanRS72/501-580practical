- Editor layout gets called sometimes when other events happen (and Notebook isn't visible)
- Add in a layout call on re-setting input so the cell is updated. This fixes the problem by laying out once the UI is visible again.

Note: long term, should really be destroying the UI (while preserving the model), then restoring it including scroll selection etc. and hooking back up to the model.

* Handle delayed Notebook provider registration
- Fixes #3197 Notebooks: builtin provider always used on reopen with notebook file visible
- Fixes #3414 Can't refresh kernel after connect to big data cluster

There are 3 parts to this fix:
- If no notebook provider other than the default is installed, we warn users and prompt to install the SQL2019 extension
- We wait on the extension host registration to complete before determining which provider to use
- We know that the extension registration of the provider instance will be after package.json is read, so if we wait after registration for 10 seconds to give this a chance to happen before returning a provider to the front end

* Remove launch.json change that was added accidentally

* Fix timeout not being the expected value

* 2 fixes :

1. Fix it so that edits made to a table with a single column will correctly create a new row when done editing. This is done by caching whether the cell is dirty in on the onCellEditEnd callback and then when onCellSelect is called to switch cells we only return early if the cell isn't dirty. Before we were returning early and thus not going into any of the code that creates the new row (submitCurrentCellChange)

2. Fix it so we don't throw an error when deleting the NULL (new) row. As noted in the code this should really be handled by not displaying the context menu to begin with for that row but that's a bit more involved of a fix so for now I'm at least making it not display an error to the user - it'll just do nothing.

Manual testing for now - I tried to add tests but the core logic and the UI layer are too intertwined so this will likely need to be a full end-to-end UI test. I'll continue working on adding some for this dialog but for now I'd like to at least submit these fixes since they're pretty painful to deal with.

- Fixed a number of existing bugs in internal actions.
  - Notably, DisconnectAction was adding a listener on each right-click on an active connection and never getting it disposed. This wasn't needed at all due to design changes.
  - Another bug fix is that the Manage action now correctly navigates to the DB dashboard for database-level connections. Before this it went to the server-level dashboard.

- Fixes #1764, fixes #1765
- Fixes bug where configModifiers were passed in the dashboard service in some places, and a different object with incompatible / missing fields in a different one. Now it always passes in the owner object, and this should have the required fields
 - Note: this doesn't fix the problem where the code does not fail to build, which I would have expected to be the case.
- Adds ""provider"" as an option for TabConfig including in the schema
- Filter by ""provider"" type when loading tabs. If provider is not set for a tab, will assume ""MSSQL"" since it's the default provider. This is a design decision - without this, we would either have to disable tabs that don't show this or have them incorrectly show for non-MSSQL provider types

Notes:

Does not override behavior for individual widgets, which still get the current provider set as their provider if not specified. This seems to be required so should be fine.

* Revised notebookActions for collapse, clear and trusted such that they can be implemented with a boolean set to T of F and show labels or shift them into tooltip for accessibility. Updated styles for select boxes. Added toolbar icons to common icon location. Split icon definition for use as masked or background-image.

* Completed styles for action icons: collapse, clear and trusted. Added theme colors. Simplified icon behavior styles.

* Made maskedIconClass optional. Added theme colors for toolbar icons, select box border and dropdown arrow. Experimenting with adding masked icon to pseudo element so I can pull out label text from icons.

* Added icons styles to handle masked SVG elements as pseudo element beside button text. Added icons using this method to respect the color theming system.

* Adjusted styles for the cell and run all icons in notebook toolbar.

* Prepped notebook toolbar with placeholder icon for Underline action. Implemented Underline action. Added custom --wip-- ButtonMenu control, a modified copy of DropDown.

* Revised colorRegistry and corresponding notebook styles. Removed unused code from new custom control: buttonMneu. Revised icon styles to create a dropdown arrow for buttonMenu.

* Added new icon for Underline action.

* Removed comment from needed markup.

* Replaced actionItemProvider with optional undefined per DropdownMenuActionViewItem constructor.

* Cleaned up new control, removing unneeded code and referencing what the class needs. Corrected style declaration for overriding input box padding. Removed unused notebook color styles. Scoped element styles to the toolbar so others outside the toolbar are not affected.

* Removed unnecessary !important from style override.

* Removed reference to unused color entry.

* Syntax cleanup.

* Put notebook toolbar improvements behind the preview flag. This involves some conditionals and CSS classes.

* Updated icon used for Manage Packages. Created and updated styles for notebook toolbar icon spacing. Modified notebook.component contributed actions so that the label text is shifted into the title attribute. Added new icon for Not Trusted toggle.

* Replaced SVG code for not-trusted icon.

* Addressed PR feedback: changed masked classname. Revised component and CSS accordingly. Removed unnecessary instance of in-preview class. Fixed code logic that assigns label text to tooltip on incoming contributed action",912,30,1,0,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","924.55"

The problems are:
- When change Kernel, setProviderIdForKernel switches Kernel first. So when we switch kernel across provider for exmple from PySpark3 to SQL. The Kernel is set SQL already in ClientSession.changeKernel. Then we lost oldKernel info.
  The fix is cache the old session in model before switch and use it to get the correct context
- SQL Kenerl could make mulitple connects from ""Add new connection"". While we didn't track them, those connections didn't close properly when close the notebook
  The fix is saving the connections made from ""Add new connection"" in model. and close them and activeConnection when close notebook

The IdGenerator was recreated each time and had a high likelihood of conflicts. Invitably after adding dozens or hundreds of icons you'll start seeing the CSS class replaced and overridden.

The solution is to do like elsewhere: have 1 const that is loaded on first import of the file and keeps a global track.

Side note is that it'd be a good idea to cache CSS rules with the same iconPath so we don't create lots of additional rules unnecessarily. If we reuse the same icon a bunch we should cache them - #2524 is tracking this.",457,10,0,1,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","310.14"

Add details for starting migration (number of logins migrating, type of logins)
Log Migration result (number of errors per step, duration of each step, type of logins, if system error occurred)
Add sql-migration extension to our telemetry
Adds details when trying to connect to target
Tracks clicking ""done"" from the wizard
Fixes bucketizing for navigating telemetry in the login migration wizard

initial support for Notebook extensibility. Fixes #3148 , Fixes #3382.

## Design notes
The extensibility patterns are modeled after the VSCode Document and Editor APIs but need to be different since core editor concepts are different - for example Notebooks have cells, and cells have contents rather than editors which have text lines.

Most importantly, a lot of the code is based on the MainThreadDocumentsAndEditors class, with some related classes (the MainThreadDocuments, and MainThreadEditors) brought in too. Given our current limitations I felt moving to add 3 full sets of extension host API classes was overkill so am currently using one. Will see if we need to change this in the future based on what we add in the additional APIs

## Limitations
The current implementation is limited to visible editors, rather than all documents in the workspace. We are not following the `openDocument` -> `showDocument` pattern, but instead just supporting `showDocument` directly.

## Changes in this PR
- Renamed existing APIs to make clear that they were about notebook contents, not about notebook behavior
- Added new APIs for querying notebook documents and editors 
- Added new API for opening a notebook
- Moved `New Notebook` command to an extension, and added an `Open Notebook` command too
- Moved notebook feature flag to the extension

## Not covered in this PR
- Need to actually implement support for defining the provider and connection IDs for a notebook. this will be important to support New Notebook from a big data connection in Object Explorer
- Need to add APIs for adding cells, to support 
- Need to implement the metadata for getting full notebook contents. I've only implemented to key APIs needed to make this all work.",651,13,0,1,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","397.33"

This change introduces new boolean flag for `addToProject`, `addScriptItem` and `addFolderItem` APIs that allows to skip files/folders if they are already included in the project file. Original behavior was to throw an error if duplicate entry is encountered, so I kept that as a default (new flag is not set).

I started by fixing the original behavior, as it was not always working as expected. In our extension that relies on `addToProject` API we've hit an issue where duplicate items were added and no errors were thrown. There was a test for this scenario, but unfortunately the test had few bugs in it as well, so I addressed that first. First issue with the test code was missing `await` on the `testUtils.shouldThrowSpecificError` calls, so test was not actually testing anything. After adding missing keywords, I hit an issue where exception was not thrown, but this turned out to be different issue, compared to what we were hitting. In the test code, it was using the very first folder from the generate list of test entires. This folder wass actually the root of the project (where sqlproj file is located), and `addToProject` API had a special case to ignore the root. This means neither first call nor second call was actually adding anything to the project and no errors were produced. I fixed this problem by using next available folder in the generated files list.

After addressing the test code I could not reproduce the issue that we were seeing with duplicate entires being added, everything was working as expected and errors were thrown. I started adding more tests that better resemble our production scenario - add files in subfolders, add files to existing project, rather than a new one. Finally I was able to reproduce the problem in tests when adding a file in a subfolder to an existing project. After investigation this turned out to be an issue with mismatch in how `relativePath` is maintained within the `FileProjectEntry`. When loading an existing project, `relativePath` is populated based on the value of the `Include` attribute of the `Build` item. This attribute is normalized to Windows-style path, using `\`, so for nested file you will have `folder\file.sql`. When adding new item to the project, one could pass either Windows or Unix-style path (`folder/file.sql`), so the path comparison between loaded Windows-style path and newly added Unix-style path was failing, resulting in them being treated as different items. In fact, `addToProject` API that we were using was relying on `Uri` helpers to extract relative path, thus the path was forced to be Unix-style and path was never the same as the loaded one. After this discovery I added a dedicated test to validate the round-trip of the `relativePath` for serialized and desirialized project file.

In order to address this problem, I updated the factory method `createFileProjectEntry` to always run `utils.convertSlashesForSqlProj` on the relative path to ensure we have Windows-style path stored in there. I also optimized the helper code slightly to not do split/join, if there are no split points in the input string, which should eliminate unnecessary array instantiation. It is worth mentioning that I had to normalize the input relative paths in the `addScriptItem` and `addFolderItem` APIs, because there is no guarantee that they will be Windows-style when we try to compare them to `relativePath` of the existing project items.

Finally I was able to add a simply flag and update the condition to return existing record, if duplicates were allowed. I also updated typings file for the extension and added tests to cover this scenario.",1017,42,1,0,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","1284.58"

The IdGenerator was recreated each time and had a high likelihood of conflicts. Invitably after adding dozens or hundreds of icons you'll start seeing the CSS class replaced and overridden.

The solution is to do like elsewhere: have 1 const that is loaded on first import of the file and keeps a global track.

Side note is that it'd be a good idea to cache CSS rules with the same iconPath so we don't create lots of additional rules unnecessarily. If we reuse the same icon a bunch we should cache them - #2524 is tracking this.",461,10,0,1,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","309.94"

In queryInput.ts we set public get uri(): string { return this.getResource().toString(true); }

* Adds heading dropdown to markdown toolbar.

* Added utility methods to help determine if the selection is a line-only or multi-line.

* Building isReplaceOperation to determine when preceeding characters need to be replaced with a new MarkdownButtonType.

* Updated comments.

* Applied changes written by Chris.

* Reverted changes to earlier stage where heading addition works just like list item additions.

* getExtendedSelectedText now returns an actual value in range for MarkdownLineType.EVERY_LINE.

* Added conditional so that Preview element is updated only when Preview is enabled.

* Updated tests for heading toolbar: heading 1, 2 and 3.

* Removed code that could not be reached.

* Corrected tests for headings.

During accessibility testing, it was discovered that screen reader does not announce what checkboxes in the tree view represent. It was merely announcing ""checkbox unchecked"", so it was not clear without visuals which checkbox the focus is on.

This change sets an `aria-label` of the checkbox elements to match the label of the owning tree node. This way the announcement becomes ""My Node; checkbox; unchecked"". This is fine as a quick solution to the problem, but in the future we may want to consider adding additional checkbox label property to the nodes exposed by the tree provider, so that each checkbox can announce additional information, if needed.",543,48,1,0,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","1475.63"

- Fixes #4129 Overlapping command help windows in notebook
  - Do not show parameter hints for inactive cells, to avoid them hanging around when no longer selected
- Fixes #4116 Notebooks: Intellisense Doesn't Work using Add New Connection
  - Move connect/disconnect logic to 1 place (code component) instead of 2
  - Handle the case where you connect after choosing active cell. We now hook to the event and update connection
- Fix issues in sql session manager where result outputs 0 rows. This was failing to show the empty resultset contents, which is a regression vs. query editor. It also put unhandled error on the debug console
- Fix #3913 Notebook: words selected in other cells should be unselected on cell change

Note: after fix, now looks as follows. Need to do follow up to get correct grid min height

* New feature for Notebooks - callout. This utilizes a modifed modal.ts that renders a small modal set to appear at the trigger event and disappear when user clicks off of it. This is intended only for micro-interactions such as inserting links, tables and images into Notebooks. Error dialogs dependent on modal have been updated to implement the modified width property correctlty.

* Modified dialogStyle names in interface. Applied updates to files dependent on this. Wired up disposable listener for browsing local files in image select callout. Renamed callout to calloutDialog.

* Converted double quotes in CSS to single quotes. Revised run method, removing the promise wrapping from the conditional.

* Passing click target to modal for positioning. Created custom buttons and click event handlers for Insert image and Insert link.  Set feature behind preview flag.

* Revised structure and styles.

* Updated component for use with ML extension. Updated ML extension code with changes for custom dialog creation.

* Fixed async context for handleBrowse. Passing the new modal properties into Dialog implementation for ML.

* Added option to suppress callout dialog header and footer from the machine learning view file. Added a compact variant of callout. Corrected Dialog tab initialization.

* Maddy/callout modifications (#13586)

* initial changes

* canSelectFolders false

* change label, placeholder text on radiobtn click

* Added support for custom XY offset to account for modal size and to provide for fine-tuning of unique modal instances.

* Updated Image icon with latest from Design.

* Replaced node process with IPathService for retreiving image file.

* Added theme color lookups to provide default colors when none are provided.

* Added async/await to tests calling transformText.

* textCell, modal - swapped out HostListener for a member method which listens for the Esc keyup. Updated templates with method call on keyup. This cleaned up the double event call whenever the Esc key was pressed. Added property to modal Cancel button call to make it a secondary button.

* Cleaned up callout styles.

* Removed color use for input fields because component code delivers theme-specific values.

* Added check for CSS class `mac` on the body tag. Added conditionals to supply alternate dialogXYOffset in the case of non-Mac environment.

* Cleanup: Simplified DialogPosition. Renamed telemtry references and dialog related methods. Corrected spelling. Added missing signatures and types. Updated warning callout link URLs.

* Removed async and await as there are no promise dependencies. Added a signature.

* Revert ""Fix windows insiders icons (#13579)"" (#13630)

Implemented in this PR

- New base dialog for anything needing to work with the controller. This is important since going from SQL -> Controller we ""should"" have the right permissions but aren't guaranteed
- Support for Mount HDFS via a dialog. Includes basic polling for success/failure, but have to give up after 2.5min as mounting could take hours. By then it's assumed to be successful since server-side has 2min timeout built in.


Not implemented in this PR

* cli: ensure ordering of rpc server messages (#183558)

* cli: ensure ordering of rpc server messages

Sending lots of messages to a stream would block them around the async
tokio mutex, which is ""fair"" so doesn't preserve ordering. Instead, use
the write_loop approach I introduced to the server_multiplexer for the
same reason some time ago.

* Add F10 keybinding for debugger step, even on Web. (#183510)

Fixes #181792.
Previously, for Web the keyboard shortcut was Alt-F10, because it was
believed that F10 could not be bound on browsers. This turned out to be
incorrect, so we make the shortcut consistent (F10) with desktop VSCode
which is also what many other debuggers use.
We keep Alt-F10 on web as a secondary keybinding to keep the experience
some web users may have gotten used to by now.

* Start single client session based on the default kernel or saved kernel in NB.

* Added kernel displayName to standardKernel.
Modified name to allign wtih Juptyer Kernel.name.
So we can show the displayName during startup and use the name to start the session.

* Change session.OnSessionReady event in KernelDropDown

* Added model.KernelChnaged for switching kernel in the same provider

* Fixed session.Ready sequence

* Fixed merge issues

* Solve merged issue

* Fixed wrong kernel name in saved NB

* Added new event in Model to notify kernel change.
Toolbar depends on ModelReady to load

* Change attachTo to wait for ModelReady like KenelDropDown

* sanitizeSavedKernelInfo to fix invalid kernel and display_name. For example: PySpark1111 and PySpark 1111

- Fixed issues with sqlCreateTable snippet, which meant it couldn't effectively be used to tab through all fields and then hit execute without errors. Specifically fixed bugs where types like NVARCHAR were incorrectly escaped and the Id part of a column was outside the name section, both causing intellisense & execution breaks
- Changed SchemaName to dbo. This helps hit the ""80% case"" where objects are in the most common schema
- Removed DatabaseName from most snippets. The core issue is this requires you to manually type the exact database name into the snippet which is really hard. We should consider having separate ""with Database"" snippets or support SQLCMD variables which would let us default to the current database without needing users to manually type them in as alternatives, but having basic snippets just work on current DB is important.",614,12,0,1,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","366.1"

* Provide aria-labels for node checkboxes in the tree view. (#17676)

During accessibility testing, it was discovered that screen reader does not announce what checkboxes in the tree view represent. It was merely announcing ""checkbox unchecked"", so it was not clear without visuals which checkbox the focus is on.

This change sets an `aria-label` of the checkbox elements to match the label of the owning tree node. This way the announcement becomes ""My Node; checkbox; unchecked"". This is fine as a quick solution to the problem, but in the future we may want to consider adding additional checkbox label property to the nodes exposed by the tree provider, so that each checkbox can announce additional information, if needed.

* Respect ARIA label specified int he tree component options. (#17674)

During accessibility testing it was discovered that tree view in our wizard reads ""Tree Node tree view"" instead of the proper label that is specified. It turned out to be the problem with the tree component, where `ariaLabel` was hardcoded to ""Tree Node"", instead of the one provided in the options.

This change addresses the problem by passing through `ariaLabel` from the options object to the underlying tree control. I also removed the default `Tree Node` hardcoded label, as it didn't make much sense. This does mean that all tree-views that do not explicitly specify their aria-label will now get an empty label. I think this is better than having unrelated, unlocalized `Tree Node`.

I'm also worried about changes to the `ariaLabel` property after the component was initialized. I updated the code to propagate the value to the underlying tree view in the `setProperties` override of the tree component and hope that it will take care of it.

* Improve accessibility for wizard steps navigation (#17669)

Our extension is relying on the wizard dialog. During accessibility testing it was discovered that wizard step buttons are being reported as links by the screen reader (NVDA, JAWS). Claimed expected behavior by the tester is that they should be announced as buttons.

I discussed this issue with accessibility SMEs and they said it is perfectly fine to keep them as links. They did mention that they would probably design the UX differently from the start, but given that we already have it this way, links are fine. They did suggest to add few additional ARIA attributes to the link elements:

- `aria-current=""step""` if the link is for the currently active step. This literally just announces ""current step"" at the end, when you focus on a link
- `aria-disabled=""true""` makes it say ""**unavailable**; link; *<step number>*"" when in NVDA ""browse"" mode and move to the grayed-out link.

So this change implements the said improvements.

* Fix #4029 Ensure changeKernels always resolves, even in error states
This is necessary to unblock reverting the kernel on canceling  Python install
- startSession now correctly sets up kernel information, since a kernel is loaded there.
- Remove call to change kernel on session initialize. This isn't needed due to refactor
- Handle kernel change failure by attempting to fall back to old kernel
- ExtensionHost $startNewSession now ensures errors are sent across the wire.
- Update AttachTo and Kernel dropdowns so they handle kernel being available. This is needed since other changes mean the session is likely ready before these get going

* Fix to handle python cancel and load existing scenarios
- Made changes to handle failure flow when Python dialog is canceled
- Made changes to handle initial load fail. Kernel and Attach To dropdowns show No Kernel / None and you can choose a kernel
- Added error wrapping in ext host so that string errors make it across and aren't lost.",870,16,0,1,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","498.05"

Fixes #3843. Now includes full fix which limits length and ensures a scrollbar is available

- Set max size for editor. 4000px gets us 200-250 lines before needing a scrollbar. 
- Adds layout updating which should also ensure accurage line highlighting to the right of the editor. What's happening is initial size is slightly off, so need to layout a 2nd time (e.g. layout once, let flex figure things out, then layout a 2nd time). This isn't optimal as there's a minor perf hit but it isn't noticeable overall.

To consider in future PRs:
- Add user configurable setting for max length?
- Handle case where we scroll to bottom but scrollbar is at the top. 
- Consider how intellisense will work on this. We may need to split into a window around the current code when sending to the kernel as it's quite likely that doing a 12K line intellisense request will be too big.",761,15,0,1,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","463.11"

Fixes #3931 
- Align run button correctly so it's centered in new cell
- Refactor to support multi-state button.
  - Hidden state is set to show execution count
  - Stopped state shows run button
  - Running state shows stop button
  - Error state (will) show error button. This isn't fully handled right now
- Add execution count to model and to SqlKernel, verify serialization, loading, update matches other notebook viewers

**Notes on implementation**:
I think this is a decent solution for a) showing execution count as text, and b) perfectly centering the run button.
 
The below solution shows count correctly up to 999 runs (that’s clicking 999 times in a single session), the icon lines up juuust about right with [ ] but for other numbers it is pretty close but probably not exactly right. I wish I could solve this to work better but trying to change text float to center etc. really isn’t working.

- Use token API to get auth token before using other endpoints. Note this needs server updates before it'll work as expected (will only checkin after verifying this)
- Add auth option in controller UI and plumb through connection save, load, and uses of the controller API
Because the swagger spec is split in 2 created new file for the 2nd swagger spec including token auth endpoints. These come from a running cluster and instructions were updated to reflect this.

New UI Changes:
- Added authentication type field with ""Basic"" and ""Windows Authentication"" as the options
- Moved error notifications to the dialog instead of separate notification window. That's the recommended pattern
- Username / password aren't required for Windows Authentication. I couldn't find a way to change required status in form container on switching from Windows => Basic Auth so have error show on clicking OK.

- Added `runCell` API. Updated runCell button to listen to events on the model so it'll reflect run cell when called from other sources
- Plumbed through kernelspec info to the extension side so when changed, it's updated
- Fixed bug in ConnectionProfile where it didn't copy from options but instead overrode with empty wrapper functions

This is a partial fix that lays groundwork for full ""Prompt to connect"" if a kernel needs a connection.
I am waiting on Yurong's refactoring of connection handling before doing any of the prompt work.

- Adds kernel metadata about whether a connection is required.
- For Jupyter, only Spark kernels are listed as requiring a connection
- If this is true and there's no active connection, will show notification and not call execute

In the future, this path will still be used if user is prompted to connect and cancels out.
The future change will be to inject a ""connect"" handler from notebook.component to the cell callback and use to set connection context",940,17,0,1,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","523.24"

* Automatically add intermediate folders for SQL project items.

While using the SQL database projects through the API, I noticed that project may end up in somewhat inconsistent state, where files will be added to the project, but their parent folders will not. This in turn resulted in failure to remove these folders from project - they will show up in the UI tree, but deleting them will cause an error. In order to align with how Visual Studio manages the projects, this change will ensure that all intermediate folders are present in the project, when new files or folders are added.

While this change improves project ""correctness"" when accessing it through SQL projects extension APIs, there is still a possibility that someone will open an ""incorrect"" previously created project. This change does not address it and folder removal may still fail.

* Update the code to never throw on duplicate items when adding files and folders to project.

After a conversation with the sqlproj owners, we agreed that there are no scenarios that would prompt us to throw an error, if duplicate item is being added to the project. Ultimately, the goal of such a request would be to have an item in the project file, which is already present, therefore the call becomes a no-op.

This allowed me to simplify the new code that was ensuring all intermediate folders are present in the project when adding files and folders.",1019,45,1,0,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","1367.41"

This was reviewed / worked on with Smitha and will be signed off on by PM via mail.
1 thing left (make run button look better when not selected) will be one in separate review.

Changes
- Add top/bottom padding to editor so it's not cramped
- Added an (on by default) setting `notebook.overrideEditorTheming`. This controls whether new colors etc. are used for notebook editors or if users should see vanilla UI like in standard editor. Settings under this flag are:
  - When unselected, editor has same color as toolbar. On selection it goes back to regular editor view so colors work ""right""
  - In standard light/dark themes we now use a filled in background color instead of border box.",774,15,0,1,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","459.29"

Our extension is relying on the wizard dialog. During accessibility testing it was discovered that wizard step buttons are being reported as links by the screen reader (NVDA, JAWS). Claimed expected behavior by the tester is that they should be announced as buttons.

I discussed this issue with accessibility SMEs and they said it is perfectly fine to keep them as links. They did mention that they would probably design the UX differently from the start, but given that we already have it this way, links are fine. They did suggest to add few additional ARIA attributes to the link elements:

- `aria-current=""step""` if the link is for the currently active step. This literally just announces ""current step"" at the end, when you focus on a link
- `aria-disabled=""true""` makes it say ""**unavailable**; link; *<step number>*"" when in NVDA ""browse"" mode and move to the grayed-out link.

So this change implements the said improvements.",545,49,1,0,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","1477.94"

* Add sqlproj property to trace the origin of the project.

As part of the database migration process (schema conversion, in particular) we want to be able to tell when converted schemas are being built/deployed to the actual database server. Given that we rely on the SQL Database Projects ADS extension for the compilation/deployment, we don't have too many options other than updating the said extension.

The suggested approach is to make the following changes:
1) Add new property to the sqlproj file (called `DatabaseSource`), which will maintain the origin(s) of the project. The property can contain multiple values (separated by semicolon), in case same project contains objects produced by multiple sources (extract schema, convert from another database, etc.).
2) During build and deploy actions, send the well-known values from the newly added property to the telemetry. We don't want to send any random value of the property, as it may raise some privacy concerns. Instead we define a list of the well-known values that we know do not carry any personal information and send those, if they are specified.

This change adds all necessary APIs to the SQl Database projects extension which will be consumed by our migration extensions to populate new `DatabaseSource` property.

* Use `undefined` instead of `null`

* Provide aria-labels for node checkboxes in the tree view. (#17676)

During accessibility testing, it was discovered that screen reader does not announce what checkboxes in the tree view represent. It was merely announcing ""checkbox unchecked"", so it was not clear without visuals which checkbox the focus is on.

This change sets an `aria-label` of the checkbox elements to match the label of the owning tree node. This way the announcement becomes ""My Node; checkbox; unchecked"". This is fine as a quick solution to the problem, but in the future we may want to consider adding additional checkbox label property to the nodes exposed by the tree provider, so that each checkbox can announce additional information, if needed.

* Respect ARIA label specified int he tree component options. (#17674)

During accessibility testing it was discovered that tree view in our wizard reads ""Tree Node tree view"" instead of the proper label that is specified. It turned out to be the problem with the tree component, where `ariaLabel` was hardcoded to ""Tree Node"", instead of the one provided in the options.

This change addresses the problem by passing through `ariaLabel` from the options object to the underlying tree control. I also removed the default `Tree Node` hardcoded label, as it didn't make much sense. This does mean that all tree-views that do not explicitly specify their aria-label will now get an empty label. I think this is better than having unrelated, unlocalized `Tree Node`.

I'm also worried about changes to the `ariaLabel` property after the component was initialized. I updated the code to propagate the value to the underlying tree view in the `setProperties` override of the tree component and hope that it will take care of it.

* Improve accessibility for wizard steps navigation (#17669)

Our extension is relying on the wizard dialog. During accessibility testing it was discovered that wizard step buttons are being reported as links by the screen reader (NVDA, JAWS). Claimed expected behavior by the tester is that they should be announced as buttons.

I discussed this issue with accessibility SMEs and they said it is perfectly fine to keep them as links. They did mention that they would probably design the UX differently from the start, but given that we already have it this way, links are fine. They did suggest to add few additional ARIA attributes to the link elements:

- `aria-current=""step""` if the link is for the currently active step. This literally just announces ""current step"" at the end, when you focus on a link
- `aria-disabled=""true""` makes it say ""**unavailable**; link; *<step number>*"" when in NVDA ""browse"" mode and move to the grayed-out link.

So this change implements the said improvements.

* Expose default database collation through 'sql-database-projects' extension API.

For the purpose of schema conversion we would need to know whether target database is configured as CI or CS. This will be used to produce a warning, if we detect a case-sensitive identifier, but database is configured as CI. In order to support this scenario we need to access `<DefaultCollation/>` property of the project.

This change adds new method to the `ISqlProject` interface that allows to read the value of the project property. There already was similar method for the SQL version/platform (`<DSP/>` property) and while working on the change, I took an opportunity to refactor the way project properties are extracted from the XML. Original code was hardcoded in the `getProjectTargetVersion` and I extracted it into separate `evaluateProjectPropertyValue` helper, that can be used in the future by any getter or access method that is supposed to return a value of the single property. This also allows us to improve the way properties are retrieved from the XML. Today the logic is very rudimentary - we read the first matching XML element with the required name. This is not correct as it does not verify the parent to be `<PropertyGroup/>`, neither it evaluates the `Condition` attributes nor property value itself. I did not invest in this, but added a TODO there explaining that the method may not perform as expected.

After the helper method was added, I updated the existing `getProjectTargetVersion` method to leverage it. The only complication here was the error throwing logic, as it was using custom error message. I preserved that, as there were tests verifying it already. For the new accessor method I did not introduce a special error message and rely on generic one I defined for use within the helper method. Additionally, for the collation we return default value of `SQL_Latin1_General_CP1_CI_AS`, if project does not have the property defined. This is what SSDT for Visual Studio shows in the UI when property is missing and I decided to align with that.

Finally, I added tests for both - original `getProjectTargetVersion` and new collation extraction method to make sure they work as expected. While working on the tests, I've noticed complaints that some rejected promises were not awaited. I added missing `await`s.",1003,43,1,0,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","1302.53"

This adds SQL Server Notebook as a built-in extension
by pulling it from blob storage.
It also adds support in mssql extension for reading the contribution points from other extensions.
This will contribute troubleshooting and other books as widgets.
In this commit:
- Bundle the extension in the build
- Bundle in sql.sh / sql.bat so it appears in local testing
- Avoid installing in Stable. Should only appear in Dev/Insiders builds
- Extensions with `notebook.books` contribution point will be discovered & their books available in MSSQL

Coming later:
- Integrate this with Maddy's work to show a Notebooks widget in the SQL Server big data cluster UI
- When clause isn't supported yet for filtering. Will be done as we refactor towards more books for different server types",963,20,0,1,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","623.17"

* Adding support for configuring SqlTools log levels from user configuration. This also adds changes to see the tail of the sqltoolsservicelayer log file in the newly created 'Output->Log (SqlTools)' channel

* Three new user settings control how logging happens. tracingLevel, logRetentionMinutes & logFilesRemovalLimit. Default tracingLevel is set to 'Critical'. 

* The logfiles include ui Extension host process id in their log file names. This ensures that filenames from multiple instances of Azure Data Studio running do not collide with each other. Furthermore log directory for  being used for the tools service backend processes. This ensures that there is no name conflict when multiple instances of azuredatastudio are running on the same box. Also when azuredatastudio is started from vscode under debugger the log directory is set to %APPDATA%\Code\mssql while the official location is %APPDATA%\azuredatastudio\mssql. So dev environment should not affect other running instances. Kindly note that all debug runs of azuredatastudio share the same directory and all non debug runs share a directory different from those running under debugger. 

* Log files older than a week get cleaned up upon start-up. The log file cleanup behavior can be controlled at user level by  logRetentionMinutes & logFilesRemovalLimit settings.",555,11,0,1,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","338.72"

During accessibility testing it was discovered that tree view in our wizard reads ""Tree Node tree view"" instead of the proper label that is specified. It turned out to be the problem with the tree component, where `ariaLabel` was hardcoded to ""Tree Node"", instead of the one provided in the options.

This change addresses the problem by passing through `ariaLabel` from the options object to the underlying tree control. I also removed the default `Tree Node` hardcoded label, as it didn't make much sense. This does mean that all tree-views that do not explicitly specify their aria-label will now get an empty label. I think this is better than having unrelated, unlocalized `Tree Node`.

I'm also worried about changes to the `ariaLabel` property after the component was initialized. I updated the code to propagate the value to the underlying tree view in the `setProperties` override of the tree component and hope that it will take care of it.",542,48,1,0,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","1475.68"

* Fix #3439 Trusted doesn't get saved in Notebooks
The main fix is to add a memento to store trust information. This is only needed for saved files - untitled files are always trusted as the user created them.
On clicking trusted or saving a file, the trusted state is cached. In the future, we will also handle code execution here too by sending notification on snapshot state.
I found issue #5506 during testing - existing issue where we should track trusted state changing on run. In the case all cells are ran, the whole notebook should become trusted.

Finally, I did a decent amount of refactoring to move more logic to the model - removing unnecessary calls from components which duplicated model behavior, moving trust notification to the model or at least the notebook service completely.

* Misc UX polishes of Quick Chat (#191483)

* Use ThemeService instead

* Uses version2 of diff editor by default.

* Context menu for Quick Search appearing in search view (#191509)

Fixes #191485

* Disable image support by default

This was the cause of the black rectangle when using the DOM renderer
and it appears it can also have that issue with the other renderers.

Fixes #191426

* cli: fix decompression loop stalling (#191512)

Fixes #191501

It turns out this was a difference in inflate/deflate implementations
between the extension/SDK and the CLI. The SDK uses Node's zlib bindings,
while by default Rust's flate2 library uses a rust port of [miniz][1].
The 'logic' in the CLI was good, but miniz does not appear to flush
decompressed data as nicely on SYNC'd boundaries as zlib does, which
caused data to 'stall'. Telling the flate2 crate to use the native
bindings fixed this.

This could also be the cause of the flakiness occasionally seen on idle
tunnel connections!

* React to window resize and remove hardcoded maxHeight in Quick Chat (#191531)

more Quick Chat polish

* Have sash take over layouting of Quick Chat until reset (double click) (#191533)

The new behavior is that when you use the sash to change the height, then you are locked into that. It's not until you double click, or clear the chat that it returns to the original behavior of being open for just the last question.

* Remove toolbar button to @-mention a response (#191534)

* behavior fixes, align more closely with editor

* behavior fixes for nb sticky scroll + css fix

* server-web: implement secret storage provider (#191538)

Works quite similarly to vscode.dev. The client has a key stored in
secret storage. The server has a key stored server-side, and issues
an http-only cookie to the client. The client can ask the server to
combine its key and the http-only cookie key to a key component, which
it combines with its local key to encrypt and decrypt data.

This logic kicks in if the web server bits see a `vscode-secret-key-path`
cookie set when it loads.

* Fix workspaceRoot macro for insights

The workspaceRoot macro wasn't working correctly for finding the queryFile. There were a couple of issues :

1. The path separators were hardcoded as / which wasn't xplat-compatible
2. They required the first section of the path was one of the folders in the workspace - e.g. if the workspace contained a folder named foo you'd have to specify ${workspaceRoot}\foo\myfile.sql. This is inconsistent with the folder logich was just appends the path after ${workspaceRoot} to the folder that's currently open

I changed the logic to just append the relative part of the path to every folder currently open in the workspace and choose the first one that it found that contained the file we were told to look for - which follows the convention the folder logic uses. If the file doesn't exist it'll just fall back to using the path without the macro (which is likely to not resolve and thus will display an error, but there's nothing we can do at that point anyways)

* Switch to using VS Code resolver (support for more than just workspaceRoot) and move resolution code into helper method so it can be used by the multiple places it's called. Added tests for the methods.

* Add test for invalid param

* Change resolveQueryFilePath to be a standalone exported function. Change it to throw if the file can't be resolved/found so callers can display error correctly. Added more tests to covery new scenarios. Switch to using pfs instead of fs for file existance checks.

* Add extra param to InsightsDialogController construction in test

* Fix formatting and test errors.

* Change to suiteSetup and suiteTeardown so the setup/teardown is only ran once instead of once per test - we don't need unique files and this stops a race condition error with deleting the test folder.

While working on the tree control for our extension, I noticed that the sample implementation was not optimal. For instance, `vscode.TreeDataProvider.onDidChangeTreeData` should only be called once for the top-most node that has changed, as all children will be refreshed as well.

This change updates the code of the sample to track state changes during propagation and only raise the event for the top-most parent node that has its state changing.

There also was an issue with root node `1` not rendering, which impacted the new algorithm, as it was not refreshing the tree, when invisible root was changing. In order to address this, I updated `getChildren` to actually return the `1` node, when root was requested. This in turn changed the presentation (`1` is now rendered in the tree) and addressed the problem with tree not refreshing when `1` is the node that raises the event.

Lastly, there is one more optimization that I didn't make due to the bug that is in the works: `getTreeItem` can actually return the `element` directly, without the copy, as it already implements `TreeComponentItem`. The problem currently is that `TreeNode` also defines an `id`, which causes an error during refresh. Once that is addressed - this part can be optimized as well.",1059,40,1,0,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","1218.53"

The IdGenerator was recreated each time and had a high likelihood of conflicts. Invitably after adding dozens or hundreds of icons you'll start seeing the CSS class replaced and overridden.

The solution is to do like elsewhere: have 1 const that is loaded on first import of the file and keeps a global track.

Side note is that it'd be a good idea to cache CSS rules with the same iconPath so we don't create lots of additional rules unnecessarily. If we reuse the same icon a bunch we should cache them - #2524 is tracking this.

* fix #123040

* Switch priority of shell/shellArgs and defaultProfile setting

Fixes #123159

We were too aggressive introducing the new default profile system as many
users (as well as dev containers, microsoft/vscode-dev-containers#838) depend
on these settings for their workflow. This also includes a change in behavior
where if shellArgs are specified, they are applied to the fallback shell
(even when shell.platform isn't specified), which aligns with past behavior.

* fixes #123036 (#123263)

* fixes #123041 (#123287)

* 1.56 fix for #123044

* Do not invoke `resolveWithInteraction` over terminal settings (#123590)

* Change grunt, gulp and jake task auto detection to be off by default (#123588)

Implements provider contribution in the MainThreadNotebook, with matching function calls in the ExtHostNotebook class.

Implemented in this PR:
- Callthroughs for content and server manager APIs
- Very basic unit tests covering provider & manager registration

Not implemented:
- Fuller unit tests on the specific callthrough methods for content & server manager.
- Contribution point needed to test this (so we can actually pass through the extension's existing Notebook implementation)",635,12,0,1,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","372.09"

Found numerous errors where icons weren't rendering correctly.
- Anything that's an action must have CSS using ""codicon"" not ""icon""
since VSCode sets the ""codicon"" class automatically.
This affected Agent view in particular, but also:
  - acounts view
  - new tab view in dashboard
 - many more
- Anything referencing the common-icons.css icons needed updating.
This hid help tooltip text in FormContainer UI for example.
- Finally I tried to convert all references from icon -> codicon,
even when the CSS was technically correct. This was done
for maintainability reasons - from now on always add codicon.

This PR enhances telemetry for login migrations (and in the following ways:

Add details for starting migration (number of logins migrating, type of logins)
Log Migration result (number of errors per step, duration of each step, type of logins, if system error occurred)
Add sql-migration extension to our telemetry
Adds details when trying to connect to target
Tracks clicking ""done"" from the wizard
Fixes bucketizing for navigating telemetry in the login migration wizard

This PR fixes an issue where the JSON-RPC Migration Service crashes when ADS is reloaded.

This situation applies when user tried to reload ADS where SQL-migration extension was running:

when connecting to DB, SQL-migration extension loads and migration service launches
if a previous MigrationService zombie process is stil running (if extension was used before), then that zombie process will have a lock on the log file
new launches of MigrationService on reloaded ADS fails b/c it can't obtain log file handle due to lock in step 2
The fix stops the MigrationService on extension deactivate and will ensure that a zombie MigrationService process isn't hanging around on reloads.

No hotfix needed as 1.4.0 was baking in insiders and has not been released to stable yet. Additionally, this mainly affects developers as they are most likely to reload ADS this way. Caveat: users do need to reload after installing latest version, however they will not hit this code path (since the migration service process is only in new versions of the extension)",319,64,1,0,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","1940.35"

* Set encoding to true (Bug fix for flavor) (#8395)

For offline scripts it shows the flavor as “Choose SQL Language”, this is because in flavorStatus.ts line 150 when we compare (uri === currentUri), the value of current Uri is ""file:///d%3A/GitHub/PGExtension/TestDatabase/1ae730a9.sql"" whereas the value for uri is ""file:///d:/GitHub/PGExtension/TestDatabase/1ae730a9.sql"" which ends up returning label ‘Choose SQL Language’.

In queryInput.ts we set public get uri(): string { return this.getResource().toString(true); }
This is the variable that we use in doChangeLanguageFlavor. And as we compare this with getEditorUri() later in flavorStatus.ts, it does not match. So enabling encoding here as well to get the encoded string in both the cases.

This is a staged refactor to use the exact same grid logic in the Notebook and query editors, including context menu support, font settings, and sizing logic. The goal long term is:
- As the core Query grid is updated, Notebook can benefit from the changes
- As we add in support for contributions like new buttons & actions working on the grid, can share the logic
- Ideally if and when we refactor things like the action bar for grid results, we can apply in both places though this is TBD.

Fixes a number of issues:
- Fixes #5755 Grids don't respond to font settings. @anthonydresser can we remove setting from each query results editor and just use Notebook Styles since these are global (not scoped) settings?
- Fixes #5501 Copy from grid settings. 
- Fixes #4938 SQL Notebook result sets are missing the actions provide for SQL File results sets. this now has the core ability to solve this, and separate work items for specific asks (serialization, charting) are tracked.

Currently hidden:
- Save as... options in context menu
- All right toolbar actions (save as, chart).

Remaining issues to address in future commits:
- Need to implement support for serialization (#5137). 
- Need to add charting support
- Need to solve the layout of buttons on the right hand side when a small number of columns are output. It doesn't look right that buttons are so far away from the results
  - Will work with UX on this. For now, mitigating this by hiding all buttons, but will need to solve in the future
- Would like to make buttons contributable via extension, but need to refactor similar to ObjectExplorer context menu so that we can serialize context menu options across to extension host while still having internal actions with full support",963,20,0,1,"2017-11-02 01:00:14","607.11"

This PR fixes a regression for migration login for MI instances that was introduced in https://github.com/microsoft/azuredatastudio/pull/21776/files#diff-93c1a62583fa32d99f775b71ad27922cf31f660d10717ecc6966784306de1b6f.

After that change, support for MI would fail as MI server types were going into the Sql VM path in sqlutils because the underlying logic for isSqlServerVM() was returning wrong results.

The new approach uses the targetType set in StateMachine to extract the correct serverName for connection string based on the targetType.

Testing:
- Tested SQL VM login migration end to end
- Tested SQL MI login migration end to end
