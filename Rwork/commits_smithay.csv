Most EGL calls return a value which indicates whether the call succeeded or
not, so avoid checking for errors when none happened.

I went for specialisation since checking for != EGL_FALSE gets redundant
pretty quickly, same for !.is_null().  There are a few functions
returning unexpected errors though, in our case eglClientWaitSync() and
eglDupNativeFenceFDANDROID(), returning respectively EGL_FALSE even
though it is a EGLint, and -1.

This has been tested with the Catacomb[1] compositor, it indeed reduces
the amount of eglGetError() calls to exactly zero according to apitrace.

Currently keycodes are always converted using xkbcommons
`State::key_get_one_sym` function. This may be not what the compositor
wants, e.g. if it represents keybindings with explicit modifiers.
Applying Shift in this case changes the sym, making it necessary for
the compositor to *undo* this transformation, which is hard or even
impossible and very unnecessary, when we have all the necessary
information in smithay.

Therefor this commit replaces the `Keysym` argument of the filter
closure with a `KeysymHandle`, which allows for different variants of
keysyms to be received. Modified (as previously), unmodified or even

Since the keymap sent for the virtual keyboard protocol is supplied by a
client, it should not be trusted. Unwrapping on it causes the compositor
to crash when a malicious or buggy client tries to send the `Keymap`
request.

To ensure even misbehaving clients don't cause any issues, requests with
invalid keymaps are simply ignored.

This has been sparked by an issue encountered with `wvkbd`, which sends
a keymap with 54 `\0` bytes at the end. While it would be possible for
Smithay to clean this up, I'm not sure if it is appropriate for the
compositor to work around what is arguably a client issue.

Creating a slice into shared memory is problematic, since this is
considered undefined behavior if the client mutates the memory. This is
especially a problem since it was creating a slice for the whole pool,
as even a correctly behaving client may mutate another buffer in the
same pool.

We don't want to trust clients not to mutate buffers for soundness, even
if it's not obvious what bugs or exploits this could result in. It's
also quite unnecessary if all we do is convert the slice back to a
pointer and pass it to OpenGL.

Memory access that could result in `SIGBUS` is probably also problematic
in access from safe Rust code that expects all memory accesses to
succeed.

This simply replaces the slice with a pointer and length, which for the
most part (with the current renderer implementation) means we're not
converting to a slice just to convert it back to a pointer again.",17,71,1

later with a some workarounds, but for now this is actually more
straight-forward to support and test.

- Add a new GL renderer, that only depends on egl as an initialization platform.
  In particular do not depend on a surface being available.
  Renderers share some basic drawing functions and may bind objects to render upon.
  E.g. surfaces or buffers, textures, etc for the gles2 renderer.
- Be explicit about extensions we require and use. Use some very very common ones
  to make our lives easier (e.g. BGRA and unpack to read in manditory shm formats).
- Enable GL debug output
- Allow more flexible rendering (e.g. 3D compositors) by allowing user-provided
  projection matrices. Also provide helper functions to allow easy-ish handling
  of surface and output transformations.
- Add API for renderers to tell the wayland-frontend about supported buffer-types.
- Also incoperate code from anvil/src/shm_load to handle buffer loading in the renderer

* xwayland: Add LaunchHelper

Calling fork() in a multi-threaded process is a bad idea. I am getting
crashes at exit() and ""man fork"" says that only async-signal-safe
functions can be called after forking in a multi-threaded process.
exit() is not async-signal safe. Thus, forking needs to happen before
any threads are created.

This commit adds a LaunchHelper to the public API. This is a handle to a
forked child process. So far this does not do much, but the intention is
to use this later instead of fork()ing directly.

Signed-off-by: Uli Schlachter <psychon@znc.in>

* xwayland: Move the fork dance to LaunchHelper

No functional changes intended. This only moves the code over and does
not actually use the LaunchHelper for anything.

Signed-off-by: Uli Schlachter <psychon@znc.in>

* Move checking the launch status to LaunchHelper

This should again have no functional changes, but the error log output
might change slightly, since an IOError instead of a NixError is
returned.

Signed-off-by: Uli Schlachter <psychon@znc.in>

* xwayland: Set $DISPLAY earlier

This way, the WM already gets the correct value of $DISPLAY.

Signed-off-by: Uli Schlachter <psychon@znc.in>

* xwayland: Use the launch helper process

FD passing is now used to give the display number and the sockets to the
launch helper process. That process then forks of the actual process
that spawns Xwayland. Once Xwayland started, this is reported back with
another write on the pipe.

Used in `ClickGrab` to prevent `motion` events from occurring with every
`button` event. Otherwise, behavior should be unchanged. This matches
the argument taken by `KeyboardInnerHandle::unset_grab`.

This seems like the simplest solution. It would also be possible to add
a method to the `PointerGrab` trait indicating if focus should be
restored, but that's complicated since `unset_grab` can't access the
grab when it's `Borrowed`, so it would have to add a bool to
`GrabStatus::Borrowed`, etc.

This still doesn't send a `frame`, but since this takes a serial and a
time, it probably will be sent along with other pointer events, and
hopefully part of a `frame`. The Wayland spec isn't all that specific
about when things can/should be part of a `frame`...

Calling `motion` is also incorrect with pointer constraints, but grabs
other than `ClickGrab` generally shouldn't exist while a constraint is
active. It would be good to enforce that some way.

I've refrained from making changes to the `change_current_state` method

is because nothing guarantees that an X11 event will come in ""soonish"".
And only then would the thread notice that its main thread is gone.

With #991 being merged, we are now calling glRenderbufferStorage with
GL_BGRA_EXT, if a renderbuffer is initialized with A/Xrgb8888 formats.

While this is technically correct, the docs of the
EXT_texture_format_BGRA8888 [1] only mention:

> This extension provides an additional format and type combination
    for use when specifying **texture data**.

This is problematic, because we are currently using a Renderbuffer for
offscreen cursor plane rendering in anvil for the `DrmCompositor`.

Furthermore glReadPixels is not guaranteed to support any read format
besides `GL_RGBA` [2]. Fortunately it is pretty likely, that the driver
will let us read the contents with GL_BGRA_EXT, if the internal storage
is also GL_BGRA_EXT (though we should really check that with
`GL_IMPLEMENTATION_COLOR_READ_FORMAT` and manually swizzle otherwise).

So lets use a texture as a framebuffer target instead of a renderbuffer,
which will satisfy the extension and no longer spam the log with
GL_INVALID_ENUM and hopefully will also let us read back the data in
BGRA ordering.

This is very much incomplete, but it implements the import and export of surfaces. However functions related to setting and imported surface the parent of another surface is not done.

importer destructor destroys all imports made from the same client 


Implement SetParentOf, no undoing yet


Add inner import type


Destroy child surface relationships when importing


A note


move init function upwards


use 0.29.0 crate


Move role string constants into the public


Use toplevel_like for surface checks in foreign


add methods to get the parent surface


Make sure ZXDG roles are public api


Consistent ordering of parameters on xdg_foreign impl methods


Let's update the changelog


Document how to use xdg_foreign


wl_shell_surface is likely invalid, so it cannot be imported or exported


Changelog suggestions


remove redundant inner ref cell


Remove all uses of the refcell like behavior


Allow compositor to export surfaces on server



Appease new clippy lints


then


Use string references and iterate in reverse to simplify removals

1. Since we're reparenting, we need to reorder the parent windows, not the
client window. Reordering occurs relative to siblings and the client windows
have no siblings under their respective parent windows. The exception is
override_redirect windows, which don't get reparented.

2. When adding windows to client_list and client_list_stacking, ignore
MapNotifys for the parent windows. If we don't, we end up with duplicates in the
lists, one entry from the client window and one from the parent window.

3. Dedupe the code of update_stacking_order_downwards and
update_stacking_order_upwards.

4. Attempt to make the docstrings of update_stacking_order_downwards and
update_stacking_order_upwards cleare. In particular, try to be consistent with
""abpve"" and ""below"" to match X11's terminology. ""before"", ""after"", ""in front
of"", and ""behind"" can be confusing, especially since client_list_stacking is
ordered bottom -> top.

5. The implementations of update_stacking_order_downwards and
update_stacking_order_upwards were seemingly swapped.",5,76,1

This seems to work at least as well as the previous version with fcitx5

This commit removes some clippy warnings (to advance #45) by doing the following:
- replace usage of `mem::uninitialized()` with `MaybeUninit`
- replace usage of `nix::libc::{uint64_t, int32_t}` with `{u64, i32}`
- replace functions inside of `Option::ok_or` with `Option::ok_or_else`
- replace functions inside of `Result::unwrap_or` with `Result::unwrap_or_else`
- replace occurrences of pass-by-reference with pass-by-value when
  appropriate
- replace unused variables in pattern-matching with wildcards
- replace `match` expressions that have only one case with `if let`

Wayland defines subsurfaces in terms of a surface with a role. Smithay
also treats it as such and this is problematic for protocol that is
designed to work with wl_subsurface objects directly. Without a
mechanism to obtain the underlying protocol implementations external to
Smithay are unable to perform any operations.

Here is an example of usage using Chrome specific protocol (whose
actually usefulness is out of scope).

augmented_sub_surface::Request::SetPosition { x, y } => {
    if x.trunc() != x || y.trunc() != y {
        info!(""Unsupported float offset x:{x} y:{y}"");
    }

With this, a lot of `Debug` implementations can just be derived, and
code can assume these types are printable without additional bounds. The
latter should  generally be an API improvement.",8,77,1

If the pointer location is tracked within Smithay, it seems bad for to
have a separate copy of it; assuming we never want them to get out of
sync. And it seems in a couple cases `pointer_location` was being
changed without emitting pointer events and changing the value within
Smithay.

The `PointerHandle` is stored in state, so it isn't necessary to call
`get_pointer` and `unwrap` everywhere. Which seems good to avoid anyway.

In the few cases where `pointer_location` was changed without emitting
pointer motion events (like with tablets) this now emits pointer events
as well.",7,78,1

This commit fixes multiple issues identified during using the IM:

1. Make IM activation/deactivation based on text-input::{enable/disable}
   and keyboard focus leave, instead of just keyboard focus changes.

2. Send `text_input::enter` on text-input creation, since some bind
   global after getting focus.

3. Don't activate IME for clients which don't have text_input
   instance, otherwise keyboard input will be disabled in general due to
   grabbing.

4. Add `new_popup` and `dismiss_popup` to update IM popup in response
   to IM text_input::{enable/disable} events.

5. Use text-input coordinates for input-method popup positioning
   IM popup positioning. The width and height mark the region you
   shouldn't obscure.

6. Fix serial handling to match input-method-v2 and text-input-v3
   specifications. input-method-v2 also requires counting amount
   of done events and using it to discard commit when it doesn't
   match text-input. text-input-v3 just wants serial with value
   equal to the number of commits being sent for the client.",5,81,1

The Vulkan1X types are not ideal for our level of abstraction nor too idomatic. Smithay intends to support higher versions of Vulkan like a superset of existing functionality. However the Vulkan1X types cannot be chained with their individual parts without validation errors. There is also the fact that these types are not available until Vulkan 1.2, and the Vulkan11 structures are actually provided in Vulkan 1.2, not Vulkan 1.1. Therefore for the sake of cleaning up the codebase, the Vulkan1X types now need to be obtained some other way if desired.",16,66,1

Previously this only sent configure if it had changed, but this doesn't
work when a client doesn't set a preferred mode and relies on the
server to define the mode.

This adds an additional variable for whether the decoration configure
event has been sent, since I don't see any indication that
`get_toplevel_decoration` couldn't be called some time after the first
`configure`.

The protocol spec also states it is a protocol error to create a
`xdg_toplevel_decoration` with a buffer attached, or to attach a buffer
before the `xdg_toplevel_decoration.configure` is received. It may be
good to enforce that, though perhaps first check the behavior of clients
and other compositors. The fact `winit` windows ever showed anything
before this change suggests it isn't following this restriction...

Fixes decoration of winit windows in cosmic-comp (and presumably other
things).",18,74,1

As described in ICCCM, ""Locally Active Input"" windows expect to receive
input focus from the WM, but may then want to set the focus to another
of its windows. So it is still necessary to call `set_input_focus` for
these applications to work correctly.

Additionally ""Globally Active Input"" windows expect to receive
`WM_TAKE_FOCUS` messages. So that needs to be sent to them.

I'm not sure if there are more subtleties in exactly when to set input
focus and when to send `WM_TAKE_FOCUS`, but this should be more correct,
at least.

Rustix doesn't provide `sigaction` since this requires libc and can't be
done correctly through just direct system calls. But just calling `libc`
isn't particularly worse than nix here.

We no longer need to define `major`/`minor` for FreeBSD since `libc` has
those in its latest release. I see an issue with DRM devices preventing
me from starting Anvil on my FreeBSD 13.2 install, but it seems to be
an issue on `master` unreleated to this change.

The `nix` dependency is still used for matching errors from the `drm`
crate... that probably should be changed in `drm`. It would be best to
avoid a public dependency on either in `drm`.",5,81,1

Using `OwnedFd` here should be safe. If `close` finds a `RawFd` that
matches, either it is a file descriptor for that device, or this is some
fd not opened through this API, and will close a device for which the fd
was already freed.

Alternately, `Session` could have an associated type, defined as
something like `libseat::Device`, and take that instead of `OwnedFd`.
But implementing `libinput::LibinputInterface` requires just taking
`OwnedFd`s, so this would mean simply moving the mapping from fds to
devices/ids to `LibinputSessionInterface` instead.

I guess in https://github.com/PolyMeilex/libseat-rs/pull/4 I was
assuming `libseat_close_device` would close the fd. As is, it isn't
possible to use that API in libseat and actually close the fd without
unsafe code. Maybe `Device` isn't necessary and it could just take the
id to close the device. If the fd outlives the device being closed, I
guess operations on it may fail? But it won't invalidate the fd, at
least. So it's not a ""safety"" issue.",5,81,1

`DrmDevice` and `UdevBackend` now do not need to be wrapped into `StateToken`s anymore, but can return a separate `SessionObserver` object using the new `AsSessionObserver` trait.

This change was motivated by allowing the `UdevHandle` to obtain a mutable reference to an `EventLoopHandle` to create wayland object, e.g. a `wl_output` object.

Previously this was not possible.

When starting xwayland with smithay, the first time I would get the
following output (do not ask what happens with displays 0, 1, 2. That's
not important right now):

happened:

The reason for the above behaviour is the
smithay::xwayland::x11_sockets::open_x11_sockets_for_display() failed.
The code successfully acquired the lock file, but then could not bind
the sockets. More specifically, the concrete socket in /tmp/.X11-unix/
already existed and thus bind() failed with EADDRINUSE.

(The code in X11Lock::grab() would then drop the already acquired
X11Lock and its Drop impl deleted the socket. Thus, when I started
things again, this time it successfully acquired display 3.)

Fix this removing the socket before trying to bind it.

This is also done by wlroots: In xwayland/sockets.x, the function
open_socket() has the same job as smithay's open_socket() function.
However, for non-abstract sockets, it would first unlink the target
before trying to bind:

        if (addr->sun_path[0]) {
                unlink(addr->sun_path);
        }

In a1e4cf3, the new `reset_buffer_age` function was added to the

themselves.

This function is not used anywhere in Smithay but could be a simpler and
more clear API for users to ""force"" redraws. However the swapchain
itself is not directly accessible to users.

This patch adds a public `reset_buffer_ages` function to all structs
providing a `reset_buffers` method as an alternative for Smithay's
consumers.

The original `reset_buffer_age` function has also been renamed to

* Add support for GPUs without instanced rendering

The patch 31b3088 introduced instanced rendering for efficiently
updating only the damaged area of the output. However due to this new
feature, support for older GPUs without instanced rendering was dropped.

This patch adds an alternative implementation which is chosen at runtime
when the target GPU does not support instanced rendering. It uses a
combination of uploading duplicate information and multiple draw calls
to somewhat efficiently mimic the effects of instanced rendering.

I've verified that with this patch it is now possible to run Anvil on my
PinePhone.",18,61,1

A compositor using it can deal with it either by following the scaling
transmitted by the backend or using some value retrieved by other means
(like a command line argument, like weston does).

This means that a non-hidpi aware implementation will appear very small
on an hidpi screen, but not broken. This is now the current state of

adding that comment everywhere would be verbose...

- Remove the `Device`, `Surface`, `RawDevice` and `RawSurface` traits.
  We are not trying to merge the different responsibilities between...
  - Drm-Surfaces: crtcs and planes for displaying buffers
  - Gbm-Surfaces: allocating and managing front- and back-buffers
  - EGL-Surfaces: Load drawing apis.
  ..anymore.
- Instead unify the legacy and atomic backends into one `DrmDevice` and
  a `DrmSurface`, that under the hood dispatches onto the different modules.
- Do not keep a list of surfaces inside the devices. These are reference-counting
  nightmares and a frequent issue due to the read-only nature of `Rc` and `Arc` and
  thread-safety related problems.
- Surfaces are mostly doing state-tracking independently of each other
  and contain some more helper functions.
- Simplify session code, because we do not need to pass the events
  through three layers of devices and surfaces anymore.
- Each surface now represents a plane. Rendering to a plane is just like
  any other rendering step, including the Cursor-plane.
  (Legacy interfaces only have one to avoid dealing with short-comings of the api).",26,51,1

wlr_data_control is a protocol used to implement clipboard managers or
access clipboard without creating a window. The implementation of it
ties to regular selections, thus the selection handling was unified
to reduce the maintainance burden.

The present selection modules, like `walyand/primary_selection` and
`wayland/data_device` moved into the new `wayland/selection` module.
Keeping their original implementation, where it was possible.

The new selection module uses the common structure of `seat_data`,
`device`, `source`, and `mod.rs` used in the said above modules, however
it uses the hand-rolled dynamic dispatch with the `selection_dispatch!`
macro. The offers and selection replies are all handled together,
so the code is unique in the most cases.

As a side effect of the selection update and merging the handling of
the primary and clipboard selection into the single `SelectionHandler`
trait (users could still just use one of them, it's not a must to have
both), the xwayland was changed to use some types from the
`wayland/selection` module.",5,80,1

We also use a shader now for clearing the screen to use instancing as

clearing parts of it.

This provides an implementation for libinput. To be useful in
compositors, an implementation of the `zwp_pointer_gestures_v1` Wayland
protocol is also needed.

Hold gestures require `libinput_1_19` so the code for that in the
libinput backend is behind a feature flag.

(Would it be better to implement this without 10 new traits and 8
associated types? In any case, this is consistent with how other event
types are handled.)",17,72,1

The current state of input events is somewhat of a tragedy for
consumers. You write your implementation in the match branch for the
individual event, then notice there are a lot of similarities, but after
you try to move it into a function you realize that all the input events
are completely separate events that just have methods named the same
way.

To allow downstream to actually make use of these traits as proper
shared functionality and write their own helper abstractions, new traits
have been introduced that are implemented for all events.

These two new traits, `PositionEvent` and `TouchEvent`, allow accessing
the slot and location of any generic input event which provides this
functionality.",17,67,1

This fixes an issue where Overlay planes were assumed to be below the

not report a zpos for the overlay plane which should still put it above

To fix this, overlay planes are now assumed to be above the primary
plane when their zpos is equal to that of the primary plane. This is
consistent with the other `is_underlay` check in
`try_assign_overlay_plane`.",19,73,1

The recent seat handling changes made in 78ebaa6 have added some
friction to the way input and specifically the keyboard is handled. This
patch aims at making it easier to migrate to the new design.

To allow for easy access to the compositor state, the state is now
passed to the closure in the keyboard's `input` function. While this
makes sense as the simplest solution to this problem, a possible
alternative would be to move this function to the seat handler in the
future.",18,67,1

reported to the previous client.

x11rb caches X11 events internally. This cache is used when waiting for
the reply of a request and an event is received first.  This cache is
however also used when sending a request, because the X11 client may
never block and stop reading while writing a request. Doing so could
cause a deadlock with the X11 server.

Thus, this commit changes X11Source to spawn a thread internally. This
thread calls wait_for_event() in a loop and uses a calloop channel to
forward these events to the main loop. x11rb's RustConnection internally
uses a ConditionVariable to make sure this thread will wake up when
needed.
