Previous to this change, the values in the Mapping node in Blender
were copied straight into the KHR_texture_transform object. This
is incorrect because the Mapping node is applied in Blender's UV
space, which is related to glTF's with the u,v->u,1-v conversion.
That meant that a Mapping node that translates up would be exported
as a KHR_texture_transform that translates down because of the
differing directions of the V axis.

The correct thing to do is to calculate the equivalent transform
in the other UV space.

Previously all images were decoded to a Python tuple of 4*w*h floats
and put into a numpy array. This was so the channels could be
assembled together for eg. metallicRoughness textures. After assembly,
the numpy array would then be converted back to a tuple, fed into the
image.pixels of a new Blender image, the image saved, and the encoded
image read back.

A special path handled images that were already saved on disk;
the file on disk would just be read, skipping the final
array->tuple->image conversion, but the initial conversion
image->tuple->array was always performed.

For most images this is wasted time and memory. The channels aren't
going to be changed, so we could have just used the original image!

So this commit makes ExportImage smarter. It now stores a description
of how its intended image should be built instead of an array of
pixel values. For example, it says its R channel should be filled by
the G channel of such-and-such image.

Then when we go to encode, we have enough information to make better
decisions about how to do it. There is a ""happy path"" where we
can just use an existing Blender image and don't ever have to
convert to Python data. The ""unhappy"" path, where we do have to
assemble an image out of channel, however, remains the same.

The happy path should contain all color image (baseColor, emission),
normal maps, and metal-rough-occlusion textures that are already
packed the way the exporter likes.

Knocks about 50% off the export time for models with lots of texture
data, and reduces memory usage.",115,17,0,0

Verts without any vertex group assignments currently export
with zero weights, which is invalid and renders differently in

to the 0th joint.

commit does NOT FIX that (unless the root bone happens to have
a default transform, so that verts skinned by it happen to
act as if they weren't skinned).",97,24,0,0
