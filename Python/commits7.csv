Some time ago we added a workaround for an msbuild bug that has since
been fixed (since the initial .NET 7 release). This workaround involved
writing build properties to a file instead of passing them on the
command line.

We no longer need the workaround, but it turnes out we still need to be
able to pass build properties in a file (because we have a test that
needs this behavior). We'll also soon run into a scenario where we need
to be able to specify a build property on the command line
(`TargetFrameworks`) - the build won't work if specified in a file.

So add support for both, and make the test that needs to specify the
build property on the command line say so explicitly.",1

When migrating Xamarin projects to .NET projects, somewhat frequently people
will leave the MtouchArch/XamMacArch properties in their project files with
old values. This won't work, since we use RuntimeIdentifier(s) now to control
the target architecture, so remove support for MtouchArch/XamMacArch, and show
an error if we detect that they're set.

This will hopefully prevent some really confusing problems, especially in the IDEs.

Example: https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/19258",1

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","rolfbjarne","[net8.0] [build] Require using EnablePreviewFeatures=true when using preview releases. Contributes towards #18343. (#18476)

Detect if we're using a non-stable Xcode, and in that case produce packages
that show an error if they're used and the EnablePreviewFeatures flag isn't
enabled.

Also add logic to set this flag for our own build, otherwise all our tests
would fail.

This is the same as Android does.

frameworks builds it could happen that if the global value has been set
to true, it will remain true for all the inner builds and affect other
target frameworks that are not compatible with Hot Restart (e.g:
MacCatalyst).

This commit adds an extra target ""_DetectBuildType"", which will set the
correct value for ""IsHotRestartBuild"" and ""IsRemoteBuild"", so any other
target that uses those properties can be sure that the values are the
right ones for the current build run.

Fixes Bug #1886158 - [MAUI][.NET8] MAUI/MAUI Blazor project build on
local device failed with error 'The ""CompileAppManifest"" task failed
unexpectedly'.:

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","rolfbjarne","[net8.0] [msbuild] Re-aot referencing assemblies. Fixes #17708. (#18518)

If an assembly changes, then we must AOT compile that assembly again (which we already
did), in addition to any assembly that references the modified assembly (which we
didn't do).

So rework the AOTCompile target: remove the Inputs and Outputs (because the dependency
tracking is too complicated for MSBuild to resolve), and instead move the logic to
detect if an assembly must be AOT-compiled again into the AOTCompile task.

This is a port of the [original fix for main][1] to .NET 8, where we have to
take the dedup assembly into account too: if any assembly has changed, then we
must re-aot the dedup assembly as well.

Fixes https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/17708.

Add partial support for the `[Preserve]` attribute for NativeAOT. This
is done by injecting an equivalent `[DynamicDependency]` attribute. The
partial support comes from the fact that there's no way to map a
conditional preserve attribute (`[Preserve (Conditional = true)]`) to a
`[DynamicDependency]` attribute, so we report a warning instead.

For non-conditional `[Preserve]` attributes, we'll now add a
`[DynamicDependency]` attribute to the assembly's module constructor for
the type/member in question, effectively rooting it.

This makes it possible to fully link all our test suites when NativeAOT
(otherwise NativeAOT would just link out all the tests, leaving the test
suites empty - and unfortunately green, so this was a rather accidental
discovery).",1

If an assembly changes, then we must AOT compile that assembly again (which we already
did), in addition to any assembly that references the modified assembly (which we
didn't do).

So rework the AOTCompile target: remove the Inputs and Outputs (because the dependency
tracking is too complicated for MSBuild to resolve), and instead move the logic to
detect if an assembly must be AOT-compiled again into the AOTCompile task.

Note that this PR has a custom port to .NET 8: #18518.

Fixes https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/17708.

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","rolfbjarne","[dotnet] Complete support for universal builds when using NativeAOT. (#19183)

We couldn't do universal builds using NativeAOT, because .NET had a sanity
check that was a bit too eager and caused unnecessary build failures. We've
now been able to add an escape hatch to that sanity check, so let's use it.

This makes universal builds using NativeAOT work, so we can also enable/add
corresponding test variations in xharness.

Also ask the runtime to allow SelfContained without a RuntimeIdentifier (the
runtime has an overeager sanity check that doesn't apply to us, so we must
skip it). Fixes #19142.

The main problem is that an app with unsigned executable code will fail any signing

This is implemented by doing two changes:

1. Augment the FilterStaticFrameworks task to only filter out frameworks with
   static libraries (and thus keeping everything that's not a static framework, even
   if it's not even a framework).

2. Execute the FilterStaticFrameworks task to filter out static frameworks from

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","rolfbjarne","[src] Throw an exception if entering methods that aren't supported with NativeAOT. (#18907)

We have numerous methods that we should never end up executing when using
NativeAOT, in particular methods called from native code.

Ideally we'd be able to link these away completely, but that's a much larger
refactoring, so in the meantime we can do something simpler: just throw an
exception in these methods if using NativeAOT.

There are two advantages:

* Smaller apps.
* No warnings from NativeAOT about these methods doing things that aren't
  trimmer-safe.

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","rolfbjarne","[net8.0] [dotnet] Add support for multi-targeting. (#18931)

Multi targetting is described here:
https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/blob/main/docs/multi-target-framework.md

This change implements support for:

* Building using the first .NET 7 packages we shipped.
* Building using the last .NET 7 packages we've shipped.

In both cases by specifying the OS version in the target framework.

Additionally adding support for any other API/OS version is trivial: it's just
a matter of listing the corresponding versions in a few files (this is
particularly interesting to add support for preview versions).

It does so by:

* Renaming the ref, sdk and runtime packs to contain the target framework and
  the target platfrom version, so the packages will now be named:

    * iOS

        * Microsoft.iOS.Sdk.net8.0_16.4
        * Microsoft.iOS.Ref.net8.0_16.4
        * Microsoft.iOS.Runtime.ios-arm64.net8.0_16.4
        * Microsoft.iOS.Runtime.iossimulator-arm64.net8.0_16.4
        * Microsoft.iOS.Runtime.iossimulator-x64.net8.0_16.4

    * tvOS

        * Microsoft.tvOS.Sdk.net8.0_16.4
        * Microsoft.tvOS.Ref.net8.0_16.4
        * Microsoft.tvOS.Runtime.ios-arm64.net8.0_16.4
        * Microsoft.tvOS.Runtime.iossimulator-arm64.net8.0_16.4
        * Microsoft.tvOS.Runtime.iossimulator-x64.net8.0_16.4

    * Mac Catalyst

        * Microsoft.MacCatalyst.Sdk.net8.0_16.4
        * Microsoft.MacCatalyst.Ref.net8.0_16.4
        * Microsoft.MacCatalyst.Runtime.maccatalyst-x64.net8.0_16.4
        * Microsoft.MacCatalyst.Runtime.maccatalyst-arm64.net8.0_16.4

    * macOS

        * Microsoft.macOS.Sdk.net8.0_13.3
        * Microsoft.macOS.Ref.net8.0_13.3
        * Microsoft.macOS.Runtime.osx-x64.net8.0_13.3
        * Microsoft.macOS.Runtime.osx-arm64.net8.0_13.3

* Updating the WorkloadManifest.json and WorkloadManifest.targets files to
  load the correct packs according to the TargetFramework in the developer's
  project.

* We're also now giving a better error message for invalid/unsupported/eol'ed
  target frameworks. Fixes https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/18790.

* Add a few tests.

Fixes:
* https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/18790.
* https://github.com/dotnet/sdk/issues/30103.
* https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/16802.

Make 'Full' the default link mode for all platforms for NativeAOT because:

* It will achieve the best app size.
* NativeAOT is not a drop-in replacement that's guaranteed to work - there are
  already known features NativeAOT don't support (and may never support), so
  this may be an opportunity for app developers (and component vendors) to
  make their products trimmer safe.
* NativeAOT will be in preview in .NET 8, so we can change our mind later if
  it turns out to cause too many problems.
* In some cases NativeAOT might require trimming, because we may
  optimize/rewrite assemblies to be NativeAOT-compatible to support existing

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","stephen-hawley","[dotnet] Test integration (#18543)

Fixed an issue where the C# class name was coming in with `,
AssemblyName` tacked on the end.
Fixed an issue where a class that had an entry in the map didn't have a
`class_ptr` which was causing an NRE.
Fixed a predicate for deciding when to mark the assembly for save.

Note - for an as yet undetermined reason, the linker is not picking up
that I'm marking the assembly for save, which is why the `true` test
cases are commented out.

While this technically won't be a supported scenario, we have tests that

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","rolfbjarne","[bgen] Add ToArray and ToFlags extension methods for strongly typed [Flags] enums. (#18925)

We have a few different implementations of how to compute a set or array of NSString
constants from an enum value, and also computing an enum value from a set or array
of NSString constants.

So add support to the generator for generating a ToArray and a ToFlags method for
these conversions, and remove all the manual code.

This has a few advantages:

* The generated code is automatically updated with new enum fields (not all previous
  implementations were).
* Reduces code duplication.
* Reduces manual code.

Additionally, when computing between a group of constants and the corresponding flags,
we have to handle any missing constants or flags gracefully, otherwise the code won’t
be forward compatible.

Example (from bug #18833):

* App developer writes code to fetch the AVCaptureMetadataOutput.AvailableMetadataObjectTypes
  property, which is an enum value of flags.
* App developer ships their app in the app store.
* Apple releases a new iOS update, adding new values and constants to the enum.
* The native [AVCaptureMetadataOutput availableMetadataObjectTypes] method returns
  these new constants.
* This means that if the AVCaptureMetadataOutput.AvailableMetadataObjectTypes property
  throws an exception if encountering unknown constants, our API wouldn’t be forward
  compatible.
* The correct solution here is that AVCaptureMetadataOutput.AvailableMetadataObjectTypes
  must ignore any constants it doesn’t know about.

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","rolfbjarne","Add special versioning rules for 'release-test/rt/' branches to have shorter versioning. (#19396)

Long versions are sometimes problematic on Windows, because of MAX_PATH
issues. Versions for release builds don't contain the pre-release part, and
are thus usually short, but pre-release versions (which include an arbitrarily
long branch name) can get too long for Windows. This is a complication when
testing a release pipeline/process: we have to use final versioning just for
testing. This isn't ideal, so we special-case branch names that start with
`release-test/rt/`:
  * Example: `iOS 15.1.123-rt` (and nothing else). This makes these versions
    exactly 3 characters longer than the release version, which is hopefully
    enough to avoid MAX_PATH issues on Windows.",1

There's some overlap here - the Assembly.GetName ().Name cache would be redundant if it was only called from Class.ResolveTokenReference - but since it's called in more places (it still shows up in profiles once Class.ResolveTokenReference is cached), I kept both caches.

issue was about: it looked like we had different behavior on macOS vs the

# Description

This PR reduces the application's SOD (size on disk) by making
`__LINKEDIT Export Info` section smaller in the stripped Mach-O
binaries.

The feature is controlled by `_ExportSymbolsExplicitly` MSBuild property
and can be disabled by specifying: `-p:_ExportSymbolsExplicitly=true`

Fixes #18332 

# Initial problem

It has been noticed that during stripping, the strip tool does not
resize the export info section after it removes the symbols. Instead it
only zeroes out the entries (achieved by calling `prune_trie` function):

- https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/cctools/blob/cctools-986/misc/strip.c
- https://github.com/apple-oss-distributions/ld64/blob/ld64-711/src/other/PruneTrie.cpp

Thanks @lambdageek for helping to track this down.

# Approach

As Xamarin build process already collects all the [required symbols][1] needed
for the application to run and preserves them during the strip phase, we can
use the same file to instruct clang toolchain to export only those symbols via
the command line options: `-exported_symbols_list <file>` ([source][2]).

This will make the export info section only include what is necessary for the
runtime - and at the same time eliminate the problem of the `strip` tool which
does not resize stripped symbols.

# Investigation setup

The issue is observable by building and inspecting the test application:
https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/blob/main/tests/dotnet/MySingleView/MySingleView.csproj
and targeting iOS platform in Release mode.

## Results:

| Measure      | MySingleView - main | MySingleView - this PR | Diff (%) | 
| :---         |                ---: |                   ---: |     ---: |
| SOD (bytes)  |            13668940 |               13458476 |    -1.5% |
| .ipa (bytes) |             4829368 |                4827928 |   -0.03% |

Even though zeroes are compressed well, the SOD is still affected and
unused section takes around 1.5% of the most simplistic app size.
Much bigger impact has been noted when trying out a MAUI iOS template
app with NativeAOT where the `__LINKEDIT Export Info` zeroes take up to
20MB of the SOD, but also with the regular macOS applications:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/86707

### Repro current state of MySingleView.app with stripped binary

1. Build the app (you can ignore the need to run the sample, I just did it to
   make sure the changes do not break anything)

```bash
make run-device
``` 

2. Print the load commands - [load_cmds_strip.list][3]

```bash
otool -l bin/Release/net7.0-ios/ios-arm64/MySingleView.app/MySingleView > load_cmds_strip.list
```

- We are interested in the export info section:

```
cmd LC_DYLD_INFO_ONLY
...
export_off 5942960
export_size 207712
```

3. Create a hex dump of the export info section - [hex_dump_strip.list][4]

``` bash
xxd -s 5942960 -l 207712 bin/Release/net7.0-ios/ios-arm64/MySingleView.app/MySingleView > hex_dump_strip.list
```

- NOTE: Notice around ~200kb of zeroes from ~0x005ab490 to ~0x005dda00
    
4. Verify exported symbols are correct - [dyld_info_strip.list][5]

``` bash
dyld_info -exports bin/Release/net7.0-ios/ios-arm64/MySingleView.app/MySingleView > dyld_info_strip.list
```

### Repro current state of MySingleView.app with unstripped binary

1. Build the app (the make target preserves the symbols)

```bash
make run-device-no-strip
``` 

2. Print the load commands - [load_cmds_nostrip.list][6]

```bash
otool -l bin/Release/net7.0-ios/ios-arm64/MySingleView.app/MySingleView > load_cmds_nostrip.list
```

- We are interested in the export info section:

```
cmd LC_DYLD_INFO_ONLY
...
export_off 5942960
export_size 207712
```

3. Create a hex dump of the export info section - [hex_dump_nostrip.list][7]

``` bash
xxd -s 5942960 -l 207712 bin/Release/net7.0-ios/ios-arm64/MySingleView.app/MySingleView > hex_dump_nostrip.list
```

- Notice that the range: ~ 0x005ab490 to ~ 0x005dda00 now includes exported symbol entries
    
4. Verify exported symbols are correct - [dyld_info_nostrip.list][8]

``` bash
dyld_info -exports bin/Release/net7.0-ios/ios-arm64/MySingleView.app/MySingleView > dyld_info_nostrip.list
```

### Repro the new approach 

1. Build the app (the make target uses the new approach)

```bash
make run-device-export-syms
``` 

2. Print the load commands - [load_cmds_export.list][9]

```bash
otool -l bin/Release/net7.0-ios/ios-arm64/MySingleView.app/MySingleView > load_cmds_export.list
```

- We are interested in the export info section ***notice the reduced size of the section***:

```
cmd LC_DYLD_INFO_ONLY
...
export_off 5942432
export_size 1048
```

3. Create a hex dump of the export info section - [hex_dump_export.list][10]

``` bash
xxd -s 5942432 -l 1048 bin/Release/net7.0-ios/ios-arm64/MySingleView.app/MySingleView > hex_dump_export.list
```
    
4. Verify exported symbols are correct - [dyld_info_export.list][11]

``` bash
dyld_info -exports bin/Release/net7.0-ios/ios-arm64/MySingleView.app/MySingleView > dyld_info_export.list
```

---

## Additional benefits

With this approach we could also switch the way strip tool is invoked to
always strip all debug and local symbols via `strip -S -x` instead of passing
the file with symbols to preserve. This would remove the warning that we are
currently getting (which is being ignored):

```
/Applications/Xcode_14.3.0.app/Contents/Developer/Toolchains/XcodeDefault.xctoolchain/usr/bin/strip: warning: removing global symbols from a final linked no longer supported.  Use -exported_symbols_list at link time when building...
```

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","simonrozsival","MSR: Generate additional constructors to reduce usage of reflection (#18529)

Closes #18357

This PR implements the idea described in the linked issue:

Whenever there's an NSObject constructor that we call from a registrar
callback, we need to create
a separate constructor that will first set the `handle` and `flags`
values of the NSObject before
calling the original constructor. Here's an example of the code we
generate:

```csharp
// The original constructor:
public .ctor (T0 p0, T1 p1, ...) { /* ... */ }

// The generated constructor with pre-initialization: 
public .ctor (T0 p0, T1 p1, ..., IntPtr handle, IManagedRegistrar dummy) {
    this.handle = (NativeHandle)handle;
    this.flags = 2; // Flags.NativeRef == 2
    this..ctor (p0, p1, ...);
}
```

- This code can't be expressed in C# and it can only be expressed
directly in IL.
- The reason we need to do this is because the base NSObject
parameterless constructor
  would allocate a new Objective-C object if `handle` is a zero pointer.
- The `IManagedRegistrar` type is added only to make the constructor
signature unique (IManagedRegistrar is not a public class and customers
can't use it in their apps directly)",0

This commit fixes the code that was added in
https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/pull/16361.

The previous change uses the version number that is part of the config
file in the current build machine. That is correct when we are working
when we are running the tests in the same machine that built them. That
IS NOT THE CASE when building on CI.

Back when the CI did the separation to accommodate the EO we noticed
that if the workload is built in a diff machine, the versions were not
to be trusted, that is why the CI sets and enviroment variable to track
the version that was built in the original step. This change check if we
are on the CI, if we are we trust the version given by the previos
machine, else we use the config one.",1

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","ivanpovazan","NativeAOT: Disable AggressiveAttributeTrimming with ILLink (#18545)

In the current setup with NativeAOT, during app build we run both ILLink
and ILCompiler in cascade.
When `_AggressiveAttributeTrimming` feature switch is set to `true`
ILLink removes `IsTrimmable` attribute from assemblies, which means that
when we are also running in `TrimMode=partial` (which translates to
`--defaultrooting` ILC command-line arguments) ILC trimming is disabled
completely.

This PR disables `_AggressiveAttributeTrimming` in the first pass ie
during trimming by ILLink and enables it in the second trimming pass
performed by ILCompiler.

Additionally, to workaround ILCompiler incompatibility with
`Microsoft.iOS` (and friends) this platform assembly is explicitly
rooted when passed to ILCompiler for trimming (this will be fixed once
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/86649 is resolved).

Estimated savings: This change reduces the size of the application
bundle by `0,58Mb` (or ~4,3% compared to the baseline)

| MAUI ios app | Base | This PR | diff (%) |
|--------------|-----------|-----------|----------|
| SOD (Mb)     | 41,93 | 40,5      | -3,4% |
| .ipa (Mb)    | 13,43  | 12,85    | -4,3% |

It's possible to create a provisioning profile for Mac Catalyst that

into this problem when publishing their apps, so avoid it by linking Mono and
Xamarin statically by default instead.

The downside is that build time might increase a little bit.

An upside however is that the app size might decrease somewhat.

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","tj-devel709","[Localization] Create a new branch for the automated PRs (#18881)

In my Localization inspection, I wanted to figure out why the automated
PRs I was creating in Pipelines were auto-closing themselves a few hours
after creating them -
[example](https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/pull/18713).

There are a few different steps in the localization process and long
story short is that I am creating these PRs from the Localization
branch. Each commit into main runs a tool that alerts the Loc team and
it syncs up our Localization branch to our main branch which temporarily
deletes our Localization branch thus closing the automated PR!

This PR creates a new unique branch for each Localization PR so that we
can keep updating the Loc team, but also make sure syncing the
Localization branch will not delete this PR.

Testing this created this PR below:

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","rolfbjarne","[UIKit] Store the delegate in a local variable in the UIContextMenuInteraction. (#19386)

The UIContextMenuInteraction type is a bit uncommon: the delegate is
passed as
an argument to the constructor, instead of setting the 'delegate'
property
later on (in fact, the 'delegate' property is read-only).

Typically, the generated WeakDelegate property will store the value in
an instance field:

	object? __mt_WeakDelegate_var;
	public virtual NSObject? WeakDelegate {
		get {
			NSObject? ret = /* ... */;
			MarkDirty ();
			__mt_WeakDelegate_var = ret;
			return ret!;
		}
	}

And in order to have the same behavior in the UIContextMenuInteraction
we need to
store the delegate passed to the constructor as well, so do that.

Otherwise the GC will eventually collect the delegate, and things stop
working.

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","rolfbjarne","[msbuild/dotnet] Handle dylibs that don't start with 'lib' better. Fixes #15044. (#18496)

For a given dylib named '/path/to/libMyLibrary.dylib', we pass this to the native linker:

    -L/path/to -lMyLibrary

however, that doesn't work unless the dylib's name starts with 'lib'.

So detect this, and if the dylib doesn't start with 'lib' (say it's just
'MyLibrary.dylib'), then just pass the path to the dylib as-is to the native
linker:

	/path/to/MyLibrary.dylib

In the makefiles it's the opposite: the final value is the last time a variable is set.

This means we must parse configuration files in the reverse order, otherwise this:

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","filipnavara","Fix non-NativeAOT builds with PublishAot=true in the project file (#18727)

The gist is:
- If you enable `<PublishAot>true</PublishAot>` then the NativeAOT build targets get included.
- Unless `NativeCompilationDuringPublish` is disabled, the NativeAOT targets are chained through `BeforeTargets` attribute to some publish targets (computing the resolved publish paths). Xamarin runs those publish targets even for non-publish builds, so it brings the whole ILC compilation along. That's undesirable.
- The `RunILLink` property is set unconditionally by the NativeAOT build integration. If we don't fix it then ILLink never runs, and neither do all the custom steps to generate registrars and `main()`.

Update: Apparently, we still need to fix runtime pack resolution for iOS-like platforms with `PublishAotUsingRuntimePack=true`.

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","rolfbjarne","Add support for using NativeAOT. (#17374)

Add support for using NativeAOT on all our platforms.

This contains numerous changes in a lot of places to add support for
NativeAOT:

* build logic
* runtime
* managed code
* tests 

And it all pretty much consists of special-casing NativeAOT everywhere
we need to.

Note: NativeAOT doesn't work on macOS yet, because a dotnet/runtime fix
is required, and thus the corresponding test variations for
monotouch-test have been commented out.

This PR is best reviewed commit-by-commit.

Apple completely removed the NewsstandKit framework in Xode 15.

While this technically won't be a supported scenario, we have tests that
ensures .NET 7 apps can be built with .NET 8, and .NET 8 will ship with Xcode
15 support. This means that in order to make these tests work, we'll otherwise
have to have Xcode 14.3 installed both locally and on bots (in addition to

Both headers and documentation agree that:

* While the NSLineBreakStrategy enum is supposedly not available in all OS

  doesn't make much sense, so I've made our enum available in all OS versions

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","simonrozsival","[managed-static-registrar] Remove use of reflection in UCOs of generic types (#18421)

Closes #18356

In the static UnmanagedCallersOnly methods we don't know the generic
parameters of the type we're working with and we need to use this trick
to be able to call methods on the generic type without using reflection.
When we call a non-generic interface method implemented on a generic
class, the .NET runtime will resolve the generic parameters for us. In
the implementation of the interface method, we can simply use the
generic parameters and generate the same code we usually generate in the
UnmanagedCallersOnly callback method.

This is an example of the code we generate in addition to user code:

```csharp
internal interface __IRegistrarGenericTypeProxy__CustomNSObject_1__
{
	void __IRegistrarGenericTypeProxy__CustomNSObject_1____SomeMethod (IntPtr p0);
}

public class CustomNSObject<T> : NSObject, __IRegistrarGenericTypeProxy__CustomNSObject_1__
	where T : NSObject
{
	[Export (""someMethod:"")]
	public void SomeMethod (T someInput)
	{
		// ...
	}

	// generated implementation of the proxy interface:
	public void __IRegistrarGenericTypeProxy__CustomNSObject_1____SomeMethod (IntPtr sel, IntPtr p0, IntPtr* exception_gchandle)
	{
		try {
			var obj0 = (T) Runtime.GetNSObject<T> (p0);
			SomeMethod (obj0);
		} catch (Exception ex) {
			*exception_gchandle = Runtime.AllocGCHandle (ex);
		}
	}

	// generated registrar callbacks:
	private static class __Registrar_Callbacks__
	{
		[UnmanagedCallersOnly (EntryPoint = ""_callback_1_CustomNSObject_1_SomeMethod"")]
		public unsafe static void callback_1_CustomNSObject_1_SomeMethod (IntPtr pobj, IntPtr sel, IntPtr p0, IntPtr* exception_gchandle)
		{
			var proxy = (__IRegistrarGenericTypeProxy__CustomNSObject_1__)Runtime.GetNSObject (pobj);
			proxy.__IRegistrarGenericTypeProxy__CustomNSObject_1____SomeMethod (sel, p0, exception_gchandle);
		}
	}
}
```
```csharp
// regular non-generic class for comparison:
public class CustomNSObject : NSObject
	where T : NSObject
{
	[Export (""someMethod:"")]
	public void SomeMethod (NSSet someInput)
	{
		// ...
	}
	
	private static class __Registrar_Callbacks__
	{
		[UnmanagedCallersOnly (EntryPoint = ""_callback_1_CustomNSObject_1_SomeMethod"")]
		public unsafe static void callback_1_CustomNSObject_1_SomeMethod (IntPtr pobj, IntPtr sel, IntPtr p0, IntPtr* exception_gchandle)
		{
			try {
				NSSet obj0 = Runtime.GetNSObject<NSSet> (p0);
				SomeMethod (obj0);
			} catch (Exception ex) {
				*exception_gchandle = Runtime.AllocGCHandle (ex);

With multi-targeting, we can end up supporting a newer target framework than

can't build Mac Catalyst projects using these newer target frameworks, because
it would require using the corresponding Xcode version, which may not be
available (in particular on bots).

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","mauroa","[remote] Explicitly import .mobile.props file (#18718)

The .mobile.props file is a file created and written by the mobile VS
extension to store property values that needs to be read early enough in
the build chain, as in design time builds, and that can't be set by CPS
because of a limitation in the project system. See more information
here: https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinVS/pull/13606

Initially it was named .user.env file and then was renamed in another PR
as part of a feedback from the project system team. See more information
here: https://github.com/xamarin/XamarinVS/pull/13628

Because this file was saved in the intermediate output path, it was
meant to be imported automatically by MSBuild, however we recently
detected that this was not happening reliably. Because of this, some
things like C# Hot Reload for iOS stopped working because Roslyn was
reading incorrect values from the Design Time Builds.

For that reason and to avoid relying on the project system, I'm
importing this file explicitly (and removing old .user.env import), so
the values in the file are always available and the dependent properties
are calculated correctly and available for all the consumers (including
Roslyn).

This should fix the following bugs:

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","rolfbjarne","[msbuild] Add support to the ResolveNativeReferences task to execute remotely. Fixes #19027. (#19047)

It looks like ResolveNativeReferences was always intended to execute remotely
from Windows (when used in the _ExpandNativeReferences target, the task is
given a session id, and only called when IsMacEnabled=true), but the task
itself never implemented the code to execute remotely.

Weirdly enough this was never an issue, because the task never did something
that had to be done on a Mac.

That is, until recently, when the task learned to decompress zip files, by
executing /usr/bin/unzip.

Obviously this doesn't work on Windows, so fix it by adding support for the
task to execute remotely.

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","rolfbjarne","[msbuild] Store the command line to sign in the stamp file. Fixes #16124. (#18750)

When figuring out whether something needs to be (re)signed or not, we must
also take into account that the signing identity may have changed (for
instance a release build will often have a different signing identity than a
debug build).

Do this by storing the command line to sign for each item we need to sign in
the stamp file, and if the stored contents don't match the new command line
to sign, then we must resign the item.

This is rather obnoxious to write unit tests for (since we'd need to have two
different signing identities available on the bots), so I've only done local
testing.

have still worked fine, therefore the tests didn't catch this bug.

1. Move the signing to after we copy files that must be signed into the app bundle
   that will be signed: we sign in the _CodesignHotRestartAppBundle target, so this
   means the targets _CopyHotRestartBundleResources and _CopyFilesToHotRestartSignedAppDirContents
   must execute first.

2. Try to clear up some confusion about the directories involved. The HotRestartSignedAppOutputDir
   property indicates the location of the _signed_ app bundle, which means no files
   should be added there. Instead files that should be signed (or present when the
   app launches) must be placed in the HotRestartAppBundlePath directory.

3. Document each property involved to try to avoid more mistakes in the future.

This API was missed because the old sim intro tests are not running and
we missed it. This was found while working on xcode15. The tvOS attr is
missing which defaults to the min version of tvOS when it should be 15.

Added a compat implementation so that the API remains.

. the Build Agent and remote tasks

DOTNET_ROOT and DOTNET_HOST_PATH are being deprecated as a mechanism to
store the location of dotnet. PATH will be used instead, so we should
ensure that the existing code that makes usage of these variables is
adapted to the new guidelines. More information:


https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/commit/f454d6960e979b6643f805f66f619650024a3f34

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/88754#issuecomment-1632957579

Additionally, to avoid confusion, we are using a dedicate
DOTNET_CUSTOM_PATH variable with the path of the dotnet used by the XMA
Build Agent, so it can be used internally by the tasks without mixing it
with the existing dotnet variables

It seems that Apple will completely remove the NewsstandKit framework from iOS 17.

This poses a problem for existing apps that link with NewsstandKit: they will
crash at launch.

Solve this by always linking weakly with the NewsstandKit framework; this way
any apps that link with it will keep working if the framework ends up being
removed by Apple.

This means:

* Change all bool and char arguments in P/Invokes to be byte and ushort, respectively.
* Change all out/ref arguments to be pointers instead.
* Update managed binding code accordingly.
* Update a struct (GKTriangle) to not use a MarshalAs field, but instead only use blittable fields.
* Update tests accordingly.

One side effect is that legacy binding projects may need a reference to
the `System.Runtime.CompilerServices.Unsafe` NuGet now (this is a
built-in dependency in .NET) in order to compile successfully.

I noticed that we're generating invalid DynamicDependency attributes for generic types and methods. For example for the `void Activated(T sender)` method of `UIKit.UIGestureRecognizer.Callback<T>`:

```c#
// before:
[DynamicDependency(""Activated(T)"", typeof(UIKit.UIGestureRecognizer.Callback<>))]

// after:
[DynamicDependency(""Activated(`0)"", ""UIKit.UIGestureRecognizer.Callback`1"", ""Microsoft.MacCatalyst"")]

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","ivanpovazan","Do not include -dead_strip when native linking a NativeAOT object file (#18553)

This PR disables passing `-dead_strip` to the native linker in case of
NativeAOT runtime to prevent build failures.

Additionally, this change affects the size of the application in the
following way - measured with `dotnet new maui` app version
`8.0.0-preview.7.23359.1`:

| MAUI iOS | -dead_strip | no -dead_strip | diff (b) | diff (Kb) | diff
(%) |
|----------|--------------|----------|----------|-----------|----------|
| .ipa (b) | 13377583 | 13435276 | 57693 | 57,693 | 0,43% |
| Size on disk (b) | 41883897 | 42038873 | 154976 | 154,976 | 0,37% |
| binary (b) | 39614336 | 39769312 | 154976 | 154,976 | 0,39% |

Even though the size of the application regresses, with this change we
have a more stable product.

Finally, once this PR gets merged we can open a tracking issue to solve
the size regression either by fixing:
- https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/88032 or
- by manually removing the dead code as proposed by @filipnavara here:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/88032#issuecomment-1624303167

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","ivanpovazan","NativeAOT: Mark module constructors in MSR  (#19097)

There is an issue with managed static registrar and explicitly rooted
assemblies (through linker descriptor files) where the linker does not
emit the created module initializer.

This was originally reported in:
https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/92106
and a smaller repro can be set up in: `tests/dotnet/MySingleView` test
project with the following changes:

### Smaller repro
1. Add a descriptor xml - `Roots.xml`
```xml
<linker>
  <assembly fullname=""MySingleView"" preserve=""All"" />
</linker>
```

2. Include the root descriptor in the `MySingleView.csproj`
```xml
<ItemGroup>
     <TrimmerRootDescriptor Condition=""'$(_RootSelf)' == 'true'"" Include=""Roots.xml"" />
</ItemGroup>
```

3.  Publish/run the app on a device
```bash
dotnet publish -c Release -r ios-arm64 -p:PublishAot=true -p:PublishAotUsingRuntimePack=true -p:_RootSelf=true -t:Run /bl
```

4. The app crashes at start up with:
```
2023-09-25 18:55:42.562 MySingleView[477:55844] *** Terminating app due to uncaught exception 'ObjCRuntime.RuntimeException', reason: 'Can't register the class MySingleView.AppDelegate when the dynamic registrar has been linked away. (ObjCRuntime.RuntimeException)
   at ObjCRuntime.Class.GetClassHandle(Type, Boolean, Boolean&) + 0x1c4
   at UIKit.UIApplication.Main(String[], Type, Type) + 0x8c
   at MySingleView!<BaseAddress>+0x2fae7c
'
```

NOTE: This is reported for NativeAOT but seems like a general problem

Additionally, here are the disassembled linked assemblies:
- regular:
https://gist.github.com/ivanpovazan/e82bdcb5313a846ff50de0a79d560553
- rooted:
https://gist.github.com/ivanpovazan/760e931fdcd3ef3e573d88087718dad2

It can be seen that the rooted one is missing:
```asm
// ================== GLOBAL METHODS =========================

.method private hidebysig specialname rtspecialname static 
        void  .cctor() cil managed
{
  // Code size       11 (0xb)
  .maxstack  1
  IL_0000:  newobj     instance void ObjCRuntime.__Registrar__::.ctor()
  IL_0005:  call       void [Microsoft.iOS]ObjCRuntime.RegistrarHelper::Register(class [Microsoft.iOS]ObjCRuntime.IManagedRegistrar)
  IL_000a:  ret
} // end of global method .cctor
```

### The fix

This PR fixes this behaviour by explicitly marking module constructor to
prevent this from happening.

Add public targets to compute the mlaunch command lines for installing

These new targets are:

* ComputeMlaunchRunArguments

As part of this change, also create a few new public properties:

* MlaunchPath
* MlaunchRunArguments
* MlaunchInstallArguments
* MlaunchRunScript
* MlaunchInstallScript

If the *Script variables are set, the corresponding target will create a
script file with the path to mlaunch + the corresponding arguments.

Otherwise, it's also possible to get the arguments directly from the
build log.

XDocument.Load(string) takes a URI, not a file path. This usually works if

with a colon (say 'a:b/some/file'), we'll get an exception about invalid uri

So instead use the XDocument.Load(Stream) overload, and create the stream
using the file path instead, in which case there's no problem with special

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","rolfbjarne","[dotnet] Work around an expectation mismatch between ILLink and library projects. Fixes #19037. (#19049)

ILLink doesn't handle library projects the way we need: the library is
automatically treated as a root assembly, with the entry point as the root.
This doesn't work, because library projects don't have an entry point.

In earlier versions of .NET (and Xamarin), we'd solved this by a custom linker
step that would manually root everything that needed to be rooted, but that
doesn't work anymore because we hit this sanity check in ILLink:

> ILLink : error IL1034: Root assembly 'MyExtension, Version=1.0.0.0, Culture=neutral, PublicKeyToken=null' does not have entry point.

Technically this happens because the library project is configured as a root
assembly, where the entry point is the root point (and in that regards the
sanity check is rather sane).

The best solution would be if we could just treat the library assembly as any
other assembly, and manually root it in our custom linker steps - but the
custom linker step we have for this kind of rooting will only iterate over
types in assemblies that are already marked somehow, and that's not
necessarily the case for app extension projects - the end result is that the
entire app extension assembly is linked away.

A close runner-up as the second best solution is to provide the API that needs
to be rooted as an xml file to the linker. This works, but we currently don't
have the infrastructure in the code to generate this xml file before running
the linker (it would be a rather major undertaking). This work is tentatively
scheduled for .NET 9 (https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/17693).

So I went for the third option: set RootMode=""Library"" for the library
assembly. I'm not sure exactly what that means ILLink will mark, but as long
as _anything_ is marked, our custom linker step will run. This seems like an
acceptable workaround until we can implement the previous solution.

Fixes https://github.com/xamarin/xamarin-macios/issues/19037.",1

would lack the manifest, and thus the main project wouldn't detect it as a
binding resource package, effectively not seeing any native resource from the
binding project.

This is a follow-up to #18854

The code that we use to generate method signatures still isn't working
properly. Method signatures that contain constructed generic types are
incorrect (this is a problem for example for UIGestureRecognizer
subclasses in MAUI). We are also handling multidimensional arrays
incorrectly.

Instead of implementing the signature builder ourselves, we can utilize
the `DocCommentId.GetDocCommentId (member)` method from
Mono.Cecil.Rocks.

```c#
void Method(IEnumerable<int> arg) { }

// before
[DynamicDependency (""Method(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable`1<System.Int32>)"", typeof (MyClass))]

// after
[DynamicDependency (""Method(System.Collections.Generic.IEnumerable{System.Int32})"", typeof (MyClass))]

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","mauroa","[dotnet][xma] Ensure we don't use DOTNET_ROOT and DOTNET_HOST_PATH in… (#18567)

… the Build Agent and remote tasks

DOTNET_ROOT and DOTNET_HOST_PATH are being deprecated as a mechanism to
store the location of dotnet. PATH will be used instead, so we should
ensure that the existing code that makes usage of these variables is
adapted to the new guidelines. More information:


https://github.com/dotnet/roslyn/commit/f454d6960e979b6643f805f66f619650024a3f34

https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/88754#issuecomment-1632957579

Additionally, to avoid confusion, we are using a dedicate
DOTNET_CUSTOM_PATH variable with the path of the dotnet used by the XMA
Build Agent, so it can be used internally by the tasks without mixing it
with the existing dotnet variables

First take at refactoring parts of the Generator:

1. RemoveArity() is now a string extension method with a test
2. FormatType, FormatTypeUsedIn, and part of PrimitiveType methods have
been moved into the TypeManager class.
3. TypeManager now has access to BindingTouch (similar to the other
Manager classes) so that it may call methods from NamespaceManager,
which also had to be made into a public property of BindingTouch vs
being passed through the Generator constructor.

It seems this target has more problems than at first I thought, so make
it easier to opt-out of it by just setting a property in the csproj.

More investigation is needed, but I'm keeping the target on by default
for now, since it solves a real-world problem as well.

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","simonrozsival","[NativeAOT] Remove unnecessary [DynamicDependency] attributes (#18808)

This is a follow-up to #18666

This PR resolves the following warnings that I've seen in build logs
when running MySingleView with NativeAOT:

```
ILLink : warning IL2034: <Module>..cctor(): The 'DynamicDependencyAttribute' could not be analyzed. [/..../xamarin/xamarin-macios/tests/dotnet/MySingleView/MySingleView.csproj]
ILLink : warning IL2034: <Module>..cctor(): The 'DynamicDependencyAttribute' could not be analyzed. [/..../xamarin/xamarin-macios/tests/dotnet/MySingleView/MySingleView.csproj]
...
```

The generated module cctor code looks like this:

```c#
internal class <Module>
{
	[DynamicDependency(""InvokeConformsToProtocol(ObjCRuntime.NativeHandle)"", typeof(NSObject))]
	[DynamicDependency(""Foundation.NSObject"", null)]
	[DynamicDependency(""ConformsToProtocol(ObjCRuntime.NativeHandle)"", typeof(NSObject))]
	[DynamicDependency(""Foundation.NSObject"", null)]
        // ...
	static <Module>()
	{
		// ...
	}
}
```

The `[DynamicDependency(""T"", null)]` attributes are invalid. We could
change them to `[DynamicDependency(DynamicallyAccessedMemberTypes.None,
typeof(T))]` but I think that attribute is redundant because the type
itself is always already preserved through the attribute that precedes
it with a selector of one of its methods/fields.",0

Per this thread:

I assume because it was not yet a function in the order of declarations. I moved helpers.canEmbedTwitch and helpers.CANT... down below where it was declared and it works now.

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","vs-mobiletools-engineering-service2","[net8.0] [hotrestart] Ensure we set the correct value for the ""IsHotRestartBuild"" property (#19112)

""IsHotRestartBuild"" is an MSBuild global property set by the VS
extension or manually when running a CLI build, however for multi target
frameworks builds it could happen that if the global value has been set
to true, it will remain true for all the inner builds and affect other
target frameworks that are not compatible with Hot Restart (e.g:
MacCatalyst).

This commit adds an extra target ""_DetectBuildType"", which will set the
correct value for ""IsHotRestartBuild"" and ""IsRemoteBuild"", so any other
target that uses those properties can be sure that the values are the
right ones for the current build run.

Fixes Bug #1886158 - [MAUI][.NET8] MAUI/MAUI Blazor project build on
local device failed with error 'The ""CompileAppManifest"" task failed
unexpectedly'.:

Currently, NativeAOT is implemented as a replacement (of sorts) for ILLink. However,

to determine what ILC does.

This might be improved in the future. Ref: https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/issues/87187.",1

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","ivanpovazan","NativeAOT: Do not suppress trim warnings by default with NativeAOT (#18759)

This PR enables trim warnings with NativeAOT by default.

In our current ILLink+ILC setup, we first need to suppress the warnings for ILLink, after which we need to enable them for ILC. 
For this reason, setting up `SuppressTrimAnalysisWarnings` properly needs to happen very early as it will get overwritten by https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/blob/45acd380b37c9ee883070a70a2ef2cb7eca77683/src/tools/illink/src/ILLink.Tasks/build/Microsoft.NET.ILLink.targets#L54-L59 

Verified with building an iOS application that the trim warnings are displayed only during ILC trimming (after `Generating native code` message below):

This is a bit non-obvious, but we later use the presence of such a
stored list to determine if we need to generate the __Registrar__ type in the
assembly.

The problem is that we need to generate the __Registrar__ type even if
no trampolines were created, because we use it for numerous other purposes
as well (type lookup for instance).

`None` seems to be equivalent to not having the attribute at all. The type will be stripped by ILLink and ILC. The `PublicConstructors | NonPublicConstructors` seems to be a better option to keep the type while making it possible to trim as much of its members as possible.

This change resolves two warnings:
```
ILLink : warning IL2037: <Module>..cctor(): No members were resolved for 'None' on type 'Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Handlers.Compatibility.FrameRenderer.FrameView'.
ILC : warning IL2037: <Module>..cctor(): No members were resolved for '0' on type 'Microsoft.Maui.Controls.Handlers.Compatibility.FrameRenderer.FrameView'. 
```
(Note: these warnings will still be present for _static_ classes which don't have a static constructor)

@rolfbjarne I believe we don't need https://github.com/dotnet/runtime/pull/90154 anymore

file in the current build machine. That is correct when we are working
when we are running the tests in the same machine that built them. That
IS NOT THE CASE when building on CI.

Back when the CI did the separation to accommodate the EO we noticed
that if the workload is built in a diff machine, the versions were not
to be trusted, that is why the CI sets and enviroment variable to track
the version that was built in the original step. This change check if we
are on the CI, if we are we trust the version given by the previos

"xamarin/xamarin-macios","mandel-macaque","[Introspection] Fix intro skip when the properties are internal.

The issue relies in the fact that this code path was not executed when
using classic because in the classic version of the SDK we added the
availavility attrs both in the property, the getters and the setters.
With dotnet, we only add the attr in the property.

The code uses the GetProperty method which does not return
internal/private properties which means that some of those properties
are not correctly skipped when on dotnet. This was discovered while
working on xcode 15.",1
